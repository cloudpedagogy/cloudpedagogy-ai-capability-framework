## 📘 About the Framework

The CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework provides a structured, future-ready model for building responsible, ethical, and transparent AI capability across complex professional environments.

It defines **six interdependent capability domains**:

1. **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
2. **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
3. **Applied Practice & Innovation**  
4. **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
5. **Decision-Making & Governance**  
6. **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

Grounded in ecological learning, systems thinking, and ethical foresight, the Framework helps individuals and organisations move beyond tool-focused AI training toward applied, reflective, and values-aligned AI capability.
