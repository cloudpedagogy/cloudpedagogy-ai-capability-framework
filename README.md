## 📘 About the Framework

The Framework provides a structured, future-ready model for building responsible, ethical, and transparent AI capability across complex professional environments.

It defines **six interdependent capability domains**:

1. **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
2. **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
3. **Generative Practice & Innovation**  
4. **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
5. **Decision-Making & Governance**  
6. **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

The Framework supports capability-building across:

- Higher education and academic development  
- Research and scholarly communication  
- Public services and government  
- Healthcare, NGOs, and humanitarian sectors  
- Digital learning, CPD, and organisational strategy  

Grounded in ecological learning, systems thinking, and ethical foresight, the Framework helps individuals and organisations move beyond tool-focused AI training toward applied, adaptive, and values-aligned AI capability.
