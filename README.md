## 📘 About the Framework

The CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework provides a structured, future-ready model for building responsible, ethical, and transparent AI capability across complex professional environments.

It defines **six interdependent capability domains**:

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
- **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
- **Applied Practice & Innovation**  
- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
- **Decision-Making & Governance**  
- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

Grounded in ecological learning, systems thinking, and ethical foresight, the Framework helps individuals and organisations move beyond tool-focused AI training toward applied, reflective, and values-aligned AI capability.

The Framework defines capability expectations; it does not prescribe specific tools, platforms, or system architectures.

### ⚙️ CloudPedagogy Course Engine

The CloudPedagogy Course Engine is an open-source, MIT-licensed software tool
designed to support transparent, reproducible course production and review.

It enables educators and institutions to compile course artefacts from a single
source of truth, inspect build metadata, and optionally declare and review
capability alignment using structured, auditable outputs.

While the Course Engine is designed around the principles of the CloudPedagogy
AI Capability Framework and Capability-Driven Development (CDD), it does not
embed, mandate, or enforce this Framework.

Capability mapping, reporting, and validation features are informational by
default and are intended to support reflection, assurance, and governance
workflows rather than determine quality, compliance, or approval outcomes.
