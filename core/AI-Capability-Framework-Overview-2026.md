**Purpose of This Guide**

This document explains what the AI Capability Framework is, why organisations across education, public services, health, NGOs and research find it useful, and what makes it uniquely suited to responsible, ethical and strategic AI readiness.

**  **

## **1. What the AI Capability Framework Is**

The CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) is a **values-based, developmental model** for building responsible, ethical and strategic AI capability across individuals, teams and organisations.

It helps users understand and apply AI safely and effectively across complex professional environments, with a focus on long-term adaptation rather than narrow tool-based training.

The Framework covers six domains:

1.  **AI Awareness & Orientation**

2.  **Human–AI Co-Agency**

3.  **Applied Practice & Innovation**

4.  **Ethics, Equity & Impact**

5.  **Decision-Making & Governance**

6.  **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

It includes:

- domain definitions

- developmental stage descriptors

- reflective questions

- governance tools

- applied cross-sector examples

- templates and checklists

- scenario-based guidance

The Framework is grounded in:

- ecological learning

- systems thinking

- design thinking

- responsible innovation

- ethics and public-good principles

It is fully open access under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

## **2. Why the Framework Is Useful**

### **AI is not just a tool — it changes roles, workflows, risk, and decisions**

Most organisations focus on *AI skills* (writing, prompting, analysis, automation).  
But AI capability must address:

- collaboration with AI

- risk and governance

- ethics and equity

- organisational workflows

- decision-making

- long-term adaptation

The Framework provides a **coherent structure** for these deeper needs.

It is useful because it helps organisations:

- build capacity safely

- govern AI responsibly

- align practice with ethics and inclusion

- support policy, curriculum and workforce development

- plan long-term capability growth

## **3. Sector-Agnostic AND Sector-Specific**

The Framework is adaptable across:

- education

- research

- NGOs

- government and public services

- healthcare

- culture and the arts

- humanitarian response

- policy and governance

The six accompanying free courses demonstrate practical application in:

- climate change

- public health

- humanitarian emergencies

- policy and governance

- equity & social justice

- creative & cultural practice

This versatility is rare among AI models.

## **4. Supports Ethical and Equitable AI Integration**

Most AI guidance mentions ethics briefly.

The Framework embeds:

- fairness

- equity

- inclusion

- long-term impact

- social responsibility

directly into its core structure (particularly Domain 4, but also across all domains).

This is essential for public institutions.

**  **

## **5. Human–AI Co-Agency (a unique strength)**

Unlike most models, the Framework includes a domain dedicated to:

- defining boundaries

- maintaining human judgement

- clarifying roles

- ensuring transparency

- designing collaboration with AI

This is a major differentiator.

## **6. Beyond Skills → Future-Ready Capability Development**

Domain 6 (Reflection, Learning & Renewal) ensures:

- continuous improvement

- evaluation

- adaptation

- governance updates

- reflective practice

This makes the Framework **sustainable and future-proof**.

**  **

## **7. Immediately Actionable, Not Abstract**

The Framework includes:

- tools

- templates

- applied examples

- reflection tasks

- governance checklists

- sector-based scenarios

- six free courses

- (and soon: automation workflows)

This makes it **usable immediately**, not only conceptually.

## **8. What Makes the Framework Unique**

- capability-based (not skills-based)

- values-driven

- integrates ethics and equity deeply

- uniquely includes co-agency and governance domains

- practical and applied

- cross-sector and internationally adaptable

- open access

- aligned with ecological and systems thinking

- supports organisational transformation

- grounded in professional, not commercial, priorities

This combination does not exist elsewhere.

## **9. Why Organisations Use It**

Institutions use the Framework to:

- build AI-readiness safely

- train staff coherently

- develop responsible AI policies

- establish governance and risk processes

- support curriculum and teaching

- maintain safeguarding and equity

- unify fragmented AI practice

- support digital strategy

- prepare for long-term change

- use a credible resource at zero cost
