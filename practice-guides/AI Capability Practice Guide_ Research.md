# **AI Capability Practice Guide: Research**

**Practical, Responsible, High-Integrity AI Use for Research & Knowledge Production**

## **Who This Guide Is For**

This guide is for people engaged in **research and knowledge production** who are already using—or are about to use—AI and want to do so:

- confidently

- responsibly

- with epistemic integrity

- without undermining authorship, methods, or trust

- without exposing themselves, participants, or institutions to avoidable risk

This includes:

- doctoral and postgraduate researchers

- postdoctoral researchers and research fellows

- principal investigators and research leads

- research assistants and analysts

- applied researchers in policy, health, NGOs, and industry

You do **not** need technical AI expertise.  
You do **not** need to study AI theory first.  
You **do** need to make defensible research decisions under real scrutiny.

This guide assumes **you remain fully responsible** for claims, methods, and interpretations—even when AI is involved.

## **Who This Guide Is Not For**

This guide is **not** designed for:

- automating or outsourcing core research reasoning

- fabricating data, evidence, or citations

- using AI as a ghost author

- bypassing ethics review, supervision, or peer scrutiny

- treating AI output as equivalent to literature, data, or analysis

If you are looking for shortcuts that replace **research judgement**, this guide will feel deliberately uncomfortable.

## **What You Will Be Able to Do in 30–60 Minutes**

By working through this guide, you will be able to:

- decide **when AI is appropriate in research—and when it is not**

- design a clear **human–AI research relationship** for a real task

- recognise **epistemic risk** (hallucination, distortion, false synthesis)

- apply lightweight but credible **research governance**

- document AI involvement in a way you can justify to supervisors, reviewers, or funders

- reflect on AI’s effect on your thinking and improve future practice

You will also produce at least **one concrete research artefact** (e.g. an AI-use note or revised workflow) that you can reuse immediately.

## **FAST START — USE THIS NOW**

If you read only one section, read this one.

This Fast Start lets you use AI **responsibly in research** within **10 minutes**, without reading the rest of the guide first.

### **When to Use This Guide**

Use this guide when:

- you feel pressure to use AI because others are doing so

- a task affects **research claims, interpretation, or credibility**

- you are unsure how much to trust an AI-generated synthesis

- the work may be scrutinised by supervisors, examiners, reviewers, or ethics panels

- AI might influence decisions that are hard to reverse

- something “feels off”, but you can’t quite articulate the risk

If none of these apply, formal guidance may not be needed yet.

**  **

## **The 10-Minute Entry Workflow (Research)**

Use this sequence **before** opening an AI tool or acting on its output.

### **Step 1 — Name the Research Task**

Write down, in plain language:

> *“I am using AI to help me with: \[specific research task\].”*

Good examples:

- exploring possible framings of a research question

- identifying themes across papers I have already read

- testing clarity of an argument for a non-expert audience

Avoid vague phrasing like *“help with my research”*.

### **Step 2 — Decide the Role of AI (Co-Agency Check)**

Ask yourself:

- What part of this task can AI **support**?

- What part must remain **human-led**?

- Who is accountable if something here is wrong?

If you cannot answer all three, **stop and refine the task**.

**  **

### **Step 3 — Apply the Research Capability Check**

Ask:

- Do I understand how an AI might generate an answer here?

- What would a **confident-sounding but wrong** output look like?

- Where would error cause real harm (credibility, ethics, trust)?

If you cannot identify plausible failure modes, you are over-trusting the output.

### **Step 4 — Run the Rapid Integrity Screen**

Ask:

- Could this distort the literature or misrepresent evidence?

- Could this introduce fabricated or unverified claims?

- Would I be comfortable defending this process in a viva, review, or audit?

If the answer is “no” or “unsure”, slow down and increase verification.

### **Step 5 — Decide the Action**

Choose one:

✅ **Proceed with AI support** (with verification)  
🔁 **Revise the task or prompt  **
⛔ **Pause and escalate** (consult supervisor, ethics lead, or methods expert)

Document the decision. One sentence is enough.

**  **

## **Worked Example — One Task, Three Outcomes (Research)**

**Task**
Using AI to help shape the literature review section of a paper.

### **✅ Good Use**

- AI suggests possible thematic groupings

- Researcher checks each theme against actual papers

- References are sourced independently

- Final structure is human-designed and defensible

**Why this works:**
AI supports sense-making without replacing engagement with literature.

### **⚠️ Risky Use**

- AI produces a polished synthesis

- Researcher lightly edits language

- Citations are assumed to be correct

**Why this is risky:**
False coherence and hallucinated references may go unnoticed.

**  **

### **⛔ Unacceptable Use**

- AI generates a full literature review section

- References are copied without checking

- Researcher cannot explain why claims are included

**Why this fails:**
Authorship, evidence, and accountability have been delegated to a system that cannot carry them.

## **Your First Research Artefact (Create This Now)**

Write a short **Research AI Use Note** (3–5 lines):

- **Research task:**

- **Role of AI:**

- **Human responsibility retained:**

- **Key risks considered:**

- **Decision made:**

This single note:

- clarifies your own thinking

- creates an audit trail

- protects you if questions arise later

You have now already **improved your research AI capability**.

**  **

## **How This Guide Works**

This guide is designed to be **used**, not read cover-to-cover.

You are expected to:

- dip in when a research situation arises

- apply a tool or checkpoint

- make a judgement

- move on

You are not expected to memorise domains.

## **The Six Domains as a Living Research Workflow**

The AI Capability Framework is built around **six domains**.  
In this guide, they operate as a **practical research workflow**, not a theory model.

You will not apply all six every time.  
You apply them **as risk and impact increase**.

**The research capability flow in practice:**

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**
  Understand how AI may mislead in research contexts.

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**
  Decide who does what—and who owns the claim.

- **Applied Practice & Innovation**
  Use AI to explore and test thinking, not replace it.

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**
  Anticipate effects on people, knowledge, and trust.

- **Decision-Making & Governance**
  Keep research decisions transparent and defensible.

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**
  Improve capability over time, not just outputs.

Skipping a domain does not save time.  
It usually moves risk downstream, where it is harder to see and harder to correct.

## **How to Use This Guide Under Time Pressure**

Most AI decisions in research are made:

- mid-analysis

- near deadlines

- under publication or funding pressure

This guide is designed for that reality.

### **If you only have 5–10 minutes**

- Use the **Fast Start**

- Clarify co-agency

- Run the integrity screen

- Document the decision

### **If you have 20–30 minutes**

- Identify the relevant situational entry point

- Apply 2–3 domains

- Use one checklist or note

- Capture one reflection insight

### **If stakes are high**

- Work through all six domains

- Focus on ethics and governance

- Prepare documentation for scrutiny

High-impact research requires **slower judgement, not faster automation**.

**  **

## **Stage 2 — How This Guide Works & Situational Entry Points (Research)**

## **HOW THIS GUIDE WORKS**

This guide is designed to support **real research decisions under pressure**.

You are **not** expected to move through it linearly.  
You are expected to:

- enter when a research situation arises

- apply one or two relevant checks

- make a defensible judgement

- return to the work

This mirrors how research actually happens:  
iterative, interrupted, and scrutinised after the fact.

## **The Six Domains as a Living Research Workflow**

The AI Capability Framework consists of six domains.  
In this guide, they act as **decision lenses**, not theory labels.

You apply **more domains as risk, impact, or uncertainty increase**.

### **The Research Capability Flow**

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**
  Understand how AI systems can mislead in research contexts.

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**
  Decide who does what—and who owns claims, methods, and interpretation.

- **Applied Practice & Innovation**
  Use AI to explore ideas without shortcutting scholarly reasoning.

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**
  Anticipate effects on participants, communities, and knowledge itself.

- **Decision-Making & Governance**
  Keep research decisions transparent, auditable, and defensible.

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**
  Learn from AI use and refine research practice over time.

Skipping a domain may feel efficient.  
It usually **moves risk downstream**, where it is harder to detect and harder to defend.

## **Why Situational Entry Points Matter in Research**

Researchers rarely start with:

> “Which AI capability domain should I apply?”

They start with:

- a looming deadline

- reviewer comments

- uncertainty about evidence

- a supervisor’s question

- ethical discomfort

- a result that looks “too clean”

Situational entry points let you start **where the research problem is**, not where the framework begins.

# **SITUATIONAL ENTRY POINTS — START HERE**

Use the entry point that best matches your current situation.  
Each one tells you **what to do next** and **which domains to prioritise**.

## **Entry Point 1 — “I need to move quickly, but I’m uneasy.”**

You feel pressure to deliver:

- an analysis

- a draft section

- a response to feedback

AI could help—but something feels risky.

### **Primary domains to apply**

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**

### **What to do now**

- Clarify which parts of the task must remain human-led

- Identify where errors would undermine credibility

- Increase verification before sharing or submission

**  **

### **Common failure mode**

- Letting speed displace epistemic caution

- Treating “draft” outputs as conceptually safe

## **Entry Point 2 — “I’m not sure AI is appropriate here.”**

You could use AI—but may be crossing a boundary:

- authorship

- methods

- interpretation

- ethics approval

### **Primary domains to apply**

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**

- **Decision-Making & Governance**

### **What to do now**

- Ask what the AI can *not* reasonably know

- Identify which judgements must remain human

- Decide whether AI should assist, inform, or be excluded

### **Common failure mode**

- Treating uncertainty as permission to experiment anyway

## **Entry Point 3 — “The output looks good, but I don’t fully trust it.”**

The AI output is fluent, coherent, and persuasive—  
but confidence is low.

### **Primary domains to apply**

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

### **What to do now**

- Identify implicit assumptions or missing caveats

- Cross-check key claims manually

- Adjust prompts or workflows for future tasks

### **Common failure mode**

- Mistaking polish for validity

## **Entry Point 4 — “This affects people beyond me.”**

The research output may affect:

- participants

- communities

- policy decisions

- public understanding

**  **

### **Primary domains to apply**

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**

- **Decision-Making & Governance**

### **What to do now**

- Identify who is affected and how

- Examine bias, framing, or representation risks

- Decide what oversight or disclosure is required

### **Common failure mode**

- Treating indirect impact as negligible

**  **

## **Entry Point 5 — “Someone might question how this was produced.”**

You anticipate scrutiny from:

- supervisors or examiners

- ethics panels

- reviewers or editors

- funders or auditors

### **Primary domains to apply**

- **Decision-Making & Governance**

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**

### **What to do now**

- Document how AI was used and where humans intervened

- Make accountability explicit

- Avoid reconstructing decisions after submission

### **Common failure mode**

- Trying to justify AI use retroactively

**  **

## **Entry Point 6 — “I want to improve my research practice, not just finish this task.”**

You are thinking beyond one project toward:

- doctoral development

- research leadership

- methodological robustness

### **Primary domains to apply**

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

- **Applied Practice & Innovation**

### **What to do now**

- Identify patterns in what AI improves and degrades

- Adjust how you design tasks and prompts

- Capture insights for reuse across projects

### **Common failure mode**

- Repeating convenient workflows without evaluation

**  **

## **How the Rest of This Guide Is Structured**

From this point on, the guide moves into the **Core Practice Workflow**.

Each domain section will:

- explain what the domain protects or enables in research

- show how to apply it immediately

- identify common research failure modes

- include a short reflection moment

You can work with:

- one domain

- several domains

- or all six

depending on the research situation you face.

**  **

## **Stage 3 — Core Practice Workflow: Domains 1–3 (Research)**

*Working Well With AI in Research Contexts*

Domains 1–3 help you use AI **without compromising epistemic integrity**, research methods, or authorship.  
These domains shape *how* you think with AI—not what AI produces.

Each domain follows the canonical structure:

- **What This Domain Protects / Enables**

- **Apply Now — Key Questions**

- **Tool in Use**

- **Common Failure Modes**

- **Quick Reflection**

**  **

# **DOMAIN 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation (Research Literacy)**

## **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects you from:

- mistaking **plausibility** for **evidence**

- believing AI has **access to knowledge it cannot have**

- accepting **fabricated citations, data, or coherence**

- letting synthetic text distort real literature

- confusing **pattern generation** with **analysis**

Researchers face a unique risk:  
AI outputs can appear **academically convincing**, even when wrong.

AI does **not** know—  
it predicts.

Awareness ensures you never confuse those two.

**  **

## **Apply Now — Key Questions**

Before using or acting on an AI output, ask:

1.  **What kind of system am I interacting with?**
    (Predictive text generator, not a reasoning agent.)

2.  **What information is it *not* trained on or cannot infer?**
    (Recent publications, proprietary datasets, disciplinary nuance.)

3.  **What would a confident-sounding error look like here?**
    (Fabricated citations, overgeneralised claims, missing caveats.)

4.  **Which part of this output would cause damage if wrong?**
    (Framings, definitions, relationships, causal suggestions.)

If you cannot identify at least one plausible failure mode, you are over-trusting the model.

## **Tool in Use — Research Awareness Check**

Use this quick template before relying on any AI-generated research text:

**AI Awareness Check (Research)**

- *What is this AI optimised to do?*

- *What is it not designed to do?*

- *Which parts of my task require evidence the AI cannot provide?*

- *What would a misleading but fluent output look like?*

Write one sentence for each.  
This prevents epistemic shortcuts.

**  **

## **Common Failure Modes in Research**

- treating AI synthesis as equivalent to reading the literature

- assuming AI “knows” niche or emergent fields

- accepting summaries without tracing claims to sources

- overlooking hallucinated citations that “look right”

- using AI descriptions as conceptual or theoretical definitions

## **Quick Reflection**

**What did I assume the AI “knew” that it could not reasonably know?**
Capture one sentence.  
This small habit produces large capability gains over time.

**  **

# **DOMAIN 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency (Research Workflow Design)**

## **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects:

- **authorship**

- **methodological integrity**

- **accountability**

- **interpretive ownership**

- **transparent research practice**

In research, co-agency is **non-negotiable**.  
If the boundary between your judgement and AI assistance is unclear, research integrity collapses silently.

AI can assist with:

- idea generation

- exploring multiple framings

- drafting structures

- producing alternative explanations

AI **cannot**:

- judge truth

- determine relevance

- make methodological choices

- interpret data

- justify claims

- carry responsibility

Only the human researcher can.

## **Apply Now — Key Questions**

Ask:

1.  **Which parts of this research task can AI support?**
    (Exploration, drafting, counter-arguments.)

2.  **Which parts must remain human-led?**
    (Interpretation, evidence evaluation, methodological reasoning.)

3.  **Who is accountable if something goes wrong here?**
    (Always you.)

4.  **What decisions must be traceable for supervisors, reviewers, or examiners?**
    (How claims were formed, how literature was interpreted.)

**  **

## **Tool in Use — Research Co-Agency Map**

A two-minute activity that prevents accidental delegation:

**Research Co-Agency Map**

- **AI may support by:**
  (e.g. generating alternative framings, proposing structure.)

- **AI may not:**
  (e.g. produce final synthesis, replace reading, justify claims.)

- **I remain responsible for:**
  (method choice, accuracy, interpretation, citation, argument.)

Use this once per meaningful research task.

## **Common Failure Modes in Research**

- accepting AI-generated conceptual categories without justification

- letting AI language shape your argument without noticing

- delegating interpretation of findings (“What does this result mean?”)

- copying structure or coherence that does not reflect actual sources

- mixing literature you read with literature AI fabricated

These failures often remain invisible until challenged by a reviewer.

**  **

## **Quick Reflection**

**Did I design the research–AI relationship intentionally, or did I let it emerge by default?**

One sentence is enough.

# **DOMAIN 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation (Safe Research Experimentation)**

## **What This Domain Enables**

This domain enables **productive, safe experimentation**, allowing AI to:

- broaden conceptual space

- generate alternative framings

- support early drafting

- reveal assumptions

- strengthen reasoning through contrast

This is where creativity lives—  
but research innovation must **never** shortcut scholarly rigor.

Innovation is valuable only when **methods, evidence, and interpretation remain intact**.

**  **

## **Apply Now — Key Questions**

Ask:

1.  **Does AI genuinely improve this research task?**
    (Not every task needs AI.)

2.  **What would “good” look like *without* AI?**
    (This prevents dependency.)

3.  **Am I using AI to explore, or to avoid thinking?**
    (Be honest.)

4.  **Is this experiment low-risk, or could it distort evidence?**
    (Exploration is fine; replacing literature is not.)

## **Tool in Use — Safe Research Experimentation Prompt**

Use this when you want AI support without epistemic shortcuts:

> *“Generate alternative framings or conceptual groupings for this topic.  
> Do not produce citations or claim accuracy.  
> I will review for validity, evidence, and alignment with accepted literature.”*

This creates **creative divergence** without blurring evidence boundaries.

**  **

## **Common Failure Modes in Research**

- using AI to generate citations or summaries instead of reading

- allowing AI’s fluency to override uncertainty or nuance

- collapsing conceptual categories based on AI’s convenience

- using AI to “decide” what interpretations are strongest

- letting AI produce analysis-like text that seems valid but is not grounded in data

## **Quick Reflection**

**What improved because I used AI—and what did not?**
Capture one insight for reuse.

**  **

# **Domains 1–3 in Practice (Research)**

Together, Domains 1–3 establish a research environment where:

- **AI supports thinking** without replacing evidence

- **the researcher remains the epistemic agent**

- **innovation strengthens**, not weakens, research quality

These domains are necessary but not sufficient.  
They prepare the foundation for Domains 4–6, which address:

- ethics

- impact

- governance

- long-term capability

These are the guardrails preventing research from drifting into irresponsible use.

**  **

## **Stage 4 — Risk, Responsibility & Renewal: Domains 4–6 (Research)**

*Governing Impact, Protecting Integrity, and Sustaining Research Capability*

Domains 4–6 come into play whenever research outputs:

- affect others,

- enter the public domain,

- influence decisions,

- shape knowledge,

- or require long-term defensibility.

These domains ensure AI use remains **ethical, transparent, equitable, and audit-ready**.

We keep the canonical structure for each domain:

- **What This Domain Protects / Enables**

- **Apply Now — Key Questions**

- **Tool in Use**

- **Common Failure Modes**

- **Quick Reflection**

**  **

# **DOMAIN 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact (Epistemic Responsibility)**

## **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects:

- fairness in knowledge production

- representation of communities and participants

- epistemic justice

- the integrity of research claims

- avoidance of harm—material, reputational, or interpretive

In research, ethics is **not limited to human subjects**.  
AI can distort:

- whose voices are centred or erased

- how phenomena are framed

- which explanations appear “normal”

- how marginalised knowledge is represented

AI amplifies dominant perspectives unless intentionally constrained.

**  **

## **Apply Now — Key Questions**

Before sharing, submitting, or embedding AI-generated content, ask:

1.  **Who is represented or misrepresented by this framing?**

2.  **Does the AI output oversimplify lived experience or sensitive topics?**

3.  **Which groups might be disadvantaged or misinterpreted?**

4.  **Does this output encode normative assumptions that need unpacking?**

5.  **If someone were harmed by this output, how difficult would it be to reverse?**

These questions matter even in desk-based and theoretical research.

## **Tool in Use — Ethical Impact Scan (Research)**

Use this 90-second scan on any AI-assisted research output:

- **Accuracy Risk:** What might be misleading or wrong?

- **Bias Risk:** Whose perspectives are missing, flattened, or treated as universal?

- **Power Risk:** Who has less ability to challenge or contest this framing?

- **Consequence Risk:** What harm would be hardest to reverse?

One sentence per risk is enough.

**  **

## **Common Failure Modes in Research**

- trusting AI’s “neutral” tone as objective

- summarising sensitive literature without cultural or contextual grounding

- letting AI implicitly define what counts as legitimate knowledge

- using AI explanations for topics involving inequality or lived experience

- assuming non-empirical work has no ethical dimension

## **Quick Reflection**

**If I were part of the community represented here, what would concern me most?**
Capture one insight.

**  **

# **DOMAIN 5 — Decision-Making & Governance (Research Integrity Infrastructure)**

## **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects:

- transparency in how claims are formed

- defensibility of research decisions

- auditability for supervisors, reviewers, examiners, funders

- traceability of human vs AI contribution

- clarity of authorship and accountability

Research governance is not bureaucracy.  
It is the infrastructure that ensures **trustworthiness**.

AI use must be:

- declared

- justified

- reviewable

especially when it shapes interpretation, structure, or claims.

**  **

## **Apply Now — Key Questions**

Before finalising a research decision influenced by AI, ask:

1.  **Did AI influence this decision directly or indirectly?**

2.  **Is this a low-risk support use or a high-stakes judgement?**

3.  **What must be documented for future scrutiny?**

4.  **Would I stand by this process in a viva, peer review, or audit?**

5.  **Does this require supervisor, ethics, or team review?**

If the answer to #5 is unclear, assume it **does require review**.

## **Tool in Use — Research Decision Transparency Log**

This is a lightweight governance artefact.  
Use it for any meaningful research decision AI touches:

**Decision Transparency Log (Research)**

- **Decision being made:**

- **Role of AI:** inform / suggest / draft / structure / generate

- **Human decision-maker:**

- **Verification performed:**

- **Escalation required? (Y/N):**

- **Notes:**

This log can be a notebook entry, a file, or a project page—  
but it **must exist**.

## **Risk Thresholds (Research Escalation Triggers)**

Escalate or require additional oversight when AI is used in:

- public-facing research communication

- abstracts, literature reviews, or methods sections

- interpretation of results

- policy-relevant research

- participant-sensitive topics

- safety-critical or regulatory domains

- anything affecting institutional reputation or funding integrity

When in doubt: **escalate**.

## **Common Failure Modes in Research**

- failing to disclose AI-mediated drafting in manuscripts

- no record of how AI shaped the literature review

- mixing human reading and AI hallucinations in the same synthesis

- relying on memory to reconstruct decisions

- assuming “everyone uses AI” means governance is optional

These failures surface during peer review—rarely earlier.

**  **

## **Quick Reflection**

**Could I explain and justify this decision six months from now?**
If not, governance is insufficient.

# **DOMAIN 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal (Sustaining Research Capability)**

## **What This Domain Sustains**

This domain sustains:

- long-term research judgement

- epistemic maturity

- adaptive expertise

- resilience against overreliance

- continuous improvement of methods and workflows

AI tools change rapidly.  
Without reflection, capability **decays** even as tools “improve.”

Reflection prevents research practice from:

- calcifying into routine

- drifting into dependency

- repeating errors

- losing visibility of how AI shapes thinking

## **Apply Now — Key Questions**

After meaningful AI use, ask:

1.  **What improved because of AI?**

2.  **Where did AI distort or oversimplify?**

3.  **What will I change in the workflow next time?**

4.  **What new risk did I discover?**

5.  **Do I need to update my co-agency boundaries?**

These questions take under five minutes.

## **Tool in Use — Mini Reflection Cycle (Research)**

A simple loop to capture and embed research learning:

**Reflect → Adjust → Reapply**

- **One insight:** What did I learn?

- **One improvement:** What will I change in my workflow?

- **One boundary reset:** What will I not allow AI to do next time?

This cycle strengthens capability more than hours of reading.

## **Common Failure Modes in Research**

- repeating prompts uncritically

- assuming past success implies future reliability

- ignoring how AI subtly shapes research language

- failing to revisit decisions after feedback or review

- treating reflection as optional instead of capability-building

## **Quick Reflection**

**What assumption about AI shifted for me during this task?**

Capture one sentence—this is your renewal boundary.

# **Domains 4–6 in Practice (Research)**

Together, these domains:

- protect people and communities

- maintain research legitimacy

- ensure auditability

- promote ethical reasoning

- sustain long-term capability

- guard against epistemic drift

They turn good use into **responsible research practice**.

The full capability cycle in research practice is:

**Awareness → Co-Agency → Practice → Ethics → Governance → Reflection → Renewal**

Skipping steps increases risk.  
Revisiting steps deepens capability.

## **Stage 5 — Capability Self-Check, Worked Research Scenario & Operating Model**

This final stage turns the guide into a **usable system**.

You will:

- locate where your research capability is strongest and weakest

- see how all six domains operate together in a real research scenario

- leave with a **personal Research AI Operating Model** you can reuse immediately

Nothing here is evaluative.  
Everything here is **practical orientation**.

## **PART A — RESEARCH AI CAPABILITY SELF-CHECK**

This is **not** an assessment and **not** a scorecard.  
Its purpose is to answer one question:

> **“Where do I need to focus next to use AI safely and well in research?”**

Complete this in **under five minutes**.

### **Domain 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation**

Ask yourself honestly:

- I understand that AI produces *plausible text*, not verified knowledge

- I routinely question synthesis and summaries rather than trusting fluency

- I can identify where hallucination or false coherence would cause damage

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mostly no:**
Pause AI use in literature or framing tasks until awareness improves.

### **Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency**

Consider:

- I explicitly decide what AI supports vs what remains human-led

- I remain comfortable explaining my role if questioned

- I never allow AI to own interpretation, judgement, or claims

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed:**
Clarify co-agency boundaries before continuing.

### **Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation**

Reflect:

- AI helps me explore ideas rather than shortcut reasoning

- I test multiple framings rather than accept first outputs

- I can imagine completing the task without AI

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mostly no:**
Shift from output extraction to safe experimentation.

**  **

### **Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact**

Ask:

- I consider who may be affected by AI-shaped research outputs

- I am alert to bias, misrepresentation, or epistemic harm

- I pause if consequences would be hard to undo

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mostly no:**
Ethics must move earlier in your workflow.

### **Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance**

Check:

- I can explain how AI influenced key research decisions

- I document AI use when it affects interpretation or outputs

- I know when escalation or review is required

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed or no:**
Introduce lightweight documentation immediately.

**  **

### **Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

Finally:

- I deliberately reflect on AI use, not just outcomes

- I adjust prompts, boundaries, or workflows over time

- I learn from errors rather than hiding them

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If inconsistent:**
Adopt a simple reflection habit.

### **Interpreting Your Self-Check**

- Gaps in **Domains 1–2** → slow down and rebuild foundations

- Gaps in **Domains 4–5** → increase oversight before scaling

- Gaps in **Domain 6** → capability will stagnate

Capability grows by **rebalancing**, not maximising.

**  **

## **PART B — WORKED RESEARCH SCENARIO (END-TO-END)**

This scenario mirrors **common, high-stakes research reality**.

### **Scenario**

You are writing the **literature review and discussion** for a paper or thesis chapter.  
You are under time pressure and considering significant AI support.

### **Domain 1 — Awareness in Action**

You recognise:

- AI can produce convincing synthesis

- AI does not verify literature

- Hallucinated citations are plausible

You therefore:

- avoid asking for “final reviews”

- treat AI outputs as hypotheses, not claims

**  **

### **Domain 2 — Co-Agency in Action**

You define boundaries:

**AI may support by:**

- proposing thematic groupings

- suggesting alternative structures

- rephrasing for clarity

**AI may not:**

- supply unchecked references

- decide what constitutes a gap

- interpret findings

You remain accountable for every claim.

### **Domain 3 — Applied Practice in Action**

You:

- conduct database searches yourself

- read and annotate papers

- use AI to explore alternative framings

- select structures that reflect *actual* literature

AI expands thinking; it does not replace reading.

**  **

### **Domain 4 — Ethics & Impact in Action**

You check:

- which voices or traditions might be flattened

- whether the synthesis privileges dominant narratives

- whether lived experience is oversimplified

You deliberately include complexity and caveats.

### **Domain 5 — Governance in Action**

You create a **Research AI Use Note** stating:

- AI assisted with structuring and language exploration

- all citations were sourced independently

- interpretation remained human-led

If questioned, the trail exists.

### **Domain 6 — Reflection in Action**

After submission or review, you ask:

- Did AI actually improve clarity or rigour?

- Where did it tempt shortcutting?

- What will change next time?

You adjust your workflow accordingly.

### **What This Scenario Shows**

Responsible AI use in research:

- redesigns thinking processes

- preserves epistemic ownership

- makes decisions defensible

- improves future practice

AI capability is not visible in the output alone.  
It is visible in **how the work was produced**.

- improving clarity of non-substantive text

**My reasons:**

### **2️⃣ My Co-Agency Rules**

**AI may:**

**AI may not:**

**I always retain responsibility for:**

**  **

### **3️⃣ My Ethical Red Lines**

I pause or stop AI use when:

- 
- 

### **4️⃣ My Governance Triggers**

I document or escalate AI use when it affects:

- literature interpretation

- analysis or discussion

- public or policy-facing outputs

- sensitive topics or communities

### **5️⃣ My Reflection Habit**

After meaningful AI use, I ask:

- What helped?

- What distorted or misled?

- What will change next time?

My reflection cadence:  
☐ after every task ☐ weekly ☐ per project

**  **

### **6️⃣ My Renewal Commitment**

To keep research capability strong, I will:

- revisit assumptions quarterly

- update boundaries as tools change

- remain alert to new epistemic risks

## **THE RESEARCH COMMITMENT**

> *I use AI to support—not substitute—scholarship.  
> I retain ownership of judgement, methods, and claims.  
> I design AI use intentionally and transparently.  
> I document decisions so my work can be trusted.  
> I reflect so my capability grows, not erodes.*
