# AI Capability Practice Guides

This directory contains the **AI Capability Practice Guides** for the *CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)*.

These guides provide **role- and context-specific applications** of the Framework, supporting confident, responsible, and defensible AI-supported practice across education, research, leadership, governance, and public-impact contexts.

They are designed to be used in real decision-making settings — including curriculum design, research practice, organisational leadership, governance, and policy — rather than as abstract theory or tool documentation.
