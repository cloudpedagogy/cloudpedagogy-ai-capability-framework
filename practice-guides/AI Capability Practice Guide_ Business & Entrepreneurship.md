# **AI Capability Practice Guide: Business & Entrepreneurship**

**Using AI to Build, Test, and Grow a Business — Without Burning Trust or Value**

## **Stage 1 — Orientation & Fast Start (Business & Entrepreneurship)**

## **Who This Guide Is For**

This guide is for people using AI **to build or grow something in the real world**, including:

- solo founders and small business owners

- startup teams and intrapreneurs

- consultants, freelancers, and creators

- product, marketing, and operations leads

- innovation and venture teams

You are:

- making decisions that affect **money, reputation, jobs, and customers  **

- under pressure to “move fast” or “leverage AI”

- aware that poor AI use can damage trust, brand, or compliance

You don’t need to be technical.  
You **do** need to design AI use that supports your business rather than quietly undermining it.

## **Who This Guide Is Not For**

This guide is **not** designed for:

- casual personal use (e.g. writing hobby blog posts)

- purely internal “sandbox” experimentation with no real stakes

- deep technical work on model training or AI engineering

- “growth hacking” that ignores ethics, privacy, or customer trust

If your goal is **only** to squeeze as much output as possible from AI, this guide will feel intentionally restrictive.

If your goal is to build a **durable, trustworthy, and resilient** business with AI in the mix, this guide is for you.

## **What You Will Be Able to Do in 30–60 Minutes**

By working through this guide, you will be able to:

- decide where AI **adds real business value** (and where it doesn’t)

- design clear **human–AI workflows** for core business tasks

- reduce the risk of **brand damage, regulatory issues, or customer backlash  **

- build **lightweight governance** into everyday commercial decisions

- avoid the trap of “AI everywhere” and focus on **AI where it matters  **

- set up a simple **operating model** for using AI in your venture

You’ll also create at least one tangible artefact, such as:

- an AI use map across your business

- a co-agency workflow for a core process (e.g. sales, marketing, product)

- a short AI use note you can share with partners or staff

## **FAST START — USE THIS NOW**

If you are **already using AI** for your business (or plan to this week), start here.

This Fast Start gets you from “AI as a shiny thing” to “AI as a controlled asset” in about **10 minutes**.

### **When to Use This Guide**

Use this guide when:

- you’re about to plug AI into a **customer-facing process  **

- AI is shaping **offers, pricing, or messaging  **

- AI is used for **screening, ranking, or shortlisting** people or opportunities

- investors or stakeholders ask, “How are you using AI?”

- you’re tempted to **automate a process that currently relies on judgement  **

- you can’t quite explain why you’re using AI in a given area

If a misstep could cost you **money, customers, partners, or legal trouble**, treat the use case as in-scope.

**  **

## **The 10-Minute Business AI Entry Workflow**

Work through this **before** embedding AI into a business process or acting on AI outputs for real decisions.

### **Step 1 — Name the Business-Critical Task**

Write, in plain language:

> *“I am using AI to help with: \[task\] so that: \[business outcome\].”*

Examples:

- qualifying inbound leads so that sales time is focused

- drafting outreach emails so that campaigns scale

- analysing feedback so that roadmap decisions improve

If you cannot explain the **business outcome**, pause. You’re likely using AI for activity, not value.

### **Step 2 — Decide the Business Role of AI (Co-Agency Check)**

Ask:

- What part of this task can AI sensibly support?

- What part must remain **human judgement, responsibility, or relationship**?

Examples of **AI-support roles** in business:

- generating options / drafts / variations

- summarising existing information

- suggesting patterns or hypotheses

Examples of **human-only responsibilities**:

- final offers, pricing, and commitments

- anything that shifts legal or contractual responsibility

- high-stakes hiring, firing, or exclusion decisions

- tone and framing in sensitive customer interactions

If you can’t clearly separate these, you’re about to blur accountability.

### **Step 3 — Apply the Primary Capability Check**

Ask:

1.  **Do I understand, at a basic level, how this AI produces answers?  **

2.  **Do I know what it is likely to get wrong in this task?  **

If the honest answer is “Not really” to either:

> Use AI only for **internal drafts and ideation**, not for decisions or direct publication.

### **Step 4 — Run the Business-Risk & Reputation Screen**

Ask:

- Who could be misled, offended, or unfairly treated by this output?

- Could this damage **trust** with customers, staff, partners, or regulators?

- Would I be comfortable showing this process to a key client or investor?

If the answer to the last question is “no” or “I don’t know”, your AI use is reputationally fragile.

**  **

### **Step 5 — Decide the Action**

Choose one of three paths:

1.  **✅ Proceed (with constraints)  **

    - AI used for support roles only

    - human signs off

    - risk and usage documented

2.  **🔁 Redesign  **

    - narrow the task

    - tighten AI’s role

    - add human review or small-scale piloting

3.  **⛔ Do not use AI here (for now)  **

    - risk or ambiguity is too high

    - non-AI methods are safer and adequate

Write down which you chose and why — even 3–4 lines. That note is part of your **business defence** later.

**  **

## **Worked Fast-Start Example — Business Context, Three Outcomes**

**Task  **
Using AI to draft outbound messages for a new B2B service.

### **✅ Acceptable, Controlled Use**

- AI generates first drafts based on **clear, accurate input  **

- Founder or marketer vets each message for:

  - truthfulness of claims

  - tone and fit with brand

  - any promises or implications

- AI is not allowed to “invent” customers, metrics, or case studies

**Why this works:  **
AI accelerates writing, but business risk remains under human control.

### **⚠️ Commercially Risky Use**

- AI drafts email copy with minimal review

- Claims are “probably fine” but not fully checked

- Brand voice is inconsistent; some messages feel generic or slightly off

**Why this is risky:  **
Short-term productivity gains may be outweighed by brand damage or trust erosion.

**  **

### **⛔ Unacceptable Use**

- AI is told “Write high-converting emails promising big results”

- Emails go out **as generated**, with invented metrics and case studies

- No human validates claims, legal exposure, or fit with positioning

**Why this fails:  **
You’ve outsourced integrity to a system that has none. Legal and reputational risk is high.

## **Your First Business AI Artefact (Create This Now)**

Write a short **Business AI Use Note** (5–7 lines) for one real task:

- **Task:  **

- **Business outcome sought:  **

- **AI role (support only / suggestion / draft):  **

- **Human responsibility:  **

- **Main risks considered (trust, accuracy, fairness, compliance):  **

- **Decision (proceed / redesign / do not use AI yet):  **

This is enough to:

- clarify your own reasoning

- show investors/partners you’re not using AI blindly

- build a pattern you can repeat across functions

You have already improved your business AI capability.

## **How This Guide Works (Business & Entrepreneurship)**

This guide is built to support **practical, commercially aware judgement**, not maximal automation.

You will use it to:

- **map where AI fits** in your business model and workflows

- **prevent silent risks** in sales, marketing, operations, product, HR, and finance

- **keep control of positioning, promises, and accountability  **

You are not expected to apply all six domains for every trivial task.  
You are expected to:

- expand AI use **only** where you can defend it commercially and ethically

- scale AI support **after** you understand the impact on customers, processes, and reputation

At a high level, in business contexts the six domains become:

- **Awareness & Orientation** — What can this system actually do for my business, and where will it fail?

- **Human–AI Co-Agency** — How do we ensure founders/managers remain fully responsible?

- **Applied Practice & Innovation** — Where can AI safely accelerate value creation or learning?

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact** — How do we avoid exploiting or misleading customers, staff, or communities?

- **Decision-Making & Governance** — How do we document and defend AI-shaped decisions?

- **Reflection & Renewal** — How do we refine our AI use as the business and environment change?

## **Stage 2 — How This Guide Works & Situational Entry Points**

This stage helps you **use the guide under real business conditions**: time pressure, uncertainty, growth targets, and competing incentives.

It answers two questions founders and business leaders actually face:

1.  *Where do I start with AI right now?  *

2.  *Which capability lens matters most in this situation?  *

You are not expected to follow this guide linearly.  
You are expected to **enter where the risk or opportunity is live**.

## **How This Guide Is Designed to Be Used**

This guide is:

- **situational**, not sequential

- **decision-focused**, not tool-focused

- **business-realistic**, not best-case hypothetical

You do **not** need to apply all six domains every time.

You **do** need to know:

- which domain prevents the most risk

- which domain unlocks the most value

- when speed is appropriate — and when it is dangerous

**  **

## **The Six Domains as a Business Workflow**

In business contexts, the AI Capability Framework operates as a **dynamic operating loop**, not a checklist.

**Business Capability Flow**

Awareness → Co-Agency → Value Creation → Ethics & Trust → Governance → Reflection → Renewal

Each domain activates when a **specific business tension** appears:

- pressure to move fast

- ambiguity about responsibility

- temptation to scale prematurely

- uncertainty around trust or compliance

- investor, customer, or regulator scrutiny

Skipping domains does not save time — it usually defers cost.

## **How to Use This Guide Under Commercial Pressure**

### **If You Have 5–10 Minutes**

- Use the **Fast Start** from Stage 1

- Clarify AI’s role and human accountability

- Run the reputation & trust screen

- Document the decision briefly

This alone dramatically reduces founder risk.

### **If You Have 20–30 Minutes**

- Identify your **situational entry point** (below)

- Apply 2–3 relevant domains

- Use one mapping or decision tool

- Capture one learning insight

This is the recommended minimum for **customer-facing or revenue-impacting work**.

### **If Stakes Are High**

Examples:

- public launch

- hiring or pricing decisions

- investor materials

- regulated industries

Then:

- work across all six domains

- slow the decision down

- increase documentation and review

- assume you will be asked to justify the process later

**  **

## **Situational Entry Points (Business Reality–First)**

Start here — **not** with the framework language.

### **Entry Point 1 — “We need to move fast.”**

You feel urgency: launch pressure, limited runway, competitive fear.

**Primary domains to apply**

- Human–AI Co-Agency

- Decision-Making & Governance

**What to do now**

- Identify what *must* remain human judgement

- Limit AI to support, not commitment

- Document decisions before acting

**Common failure mode**

- Speed substituting for thinking

- “We’ll clean it up later” logic

### **Entry Point 2 — “AI looks like it could scale this.”**

You see AI as a multiplier for marketing, sales, ops, or support.

**Primary domains**

- Applied Practice & Innovation

- Ethics, Equity & Impact

**What to do now**

- Start with *internal* use or small-scale pilots

- Identify where scale increases harm or trust risk

- Resist default automation

**Common failure mode**

- Scaling bad assumptions faster

- Optimising efficiency at the cost of trust

### **Entry Point 3 — “This affects customers directly.”**

The output will be seen, felt, or relied on externally.

**Primary domains**

- Ethics, Equity & Impact

- Governance

**What to do now**

- Ask who is most vulnerable to mistakes

- Check claims, tone, fairness, and exclusion risks

- Decide what disclosure or review is appropriate

**Common failure mode**

- Treating “non-technical” outputs as low-risk

**  **

### **Entry Point 4 — “We’re letting AI rank, filter, or recommend.”**

AI influences who gets seen, prioritised, or excluded.

**Primary domains**

- Awareness & Orientation

- Ethics, Equity & Impact

**What to do now**

- Identify what criteria AI uses implicitly

- Watch for bias amplification

- Ensure humans can override outputs

**Common failure mode**

- Assuming algorithmic decisions are neutral

### **Entry Point 5 — “An investor, client, or partner asked about our AI use.”**

Scrutiny is explicit or implicit.

**Primary domains**

- Decision-Making & Governance

- Human–AI Co-Agency

**What to do now**

- Clarify boundaries and accountability

- Show intentional, restrained AI use

- Avoid vague or inflated claims

**Common failure mode**

- Overselling AI sophistication

- Inability to explain risk management

### **Entry Point 6 — “We want to be genuinely better, not just faster.”**

You care about building a **durable business**, not short-term hacks.

**Primary domains**

- Reflection, Learning & Renewal

- Applied Practice & Innovation

**What to do now**

- Identify patterns in what AI improves vs degrades

- Adjust prompts, workflows, and boundaries

- Treat AI capability as a strategic asset

**Common failure mode**

- Repeating shallow usage patterns without learning

**  **

## **Why This Entry-Point Approach Matters in Business**

Businesses fail with AI not because:

- the tools weren’t powerful

- people lacked enthusiasm

…but because:

- responsibility drifted

- trust eroded quietly

- risks were discovered too late

Situational entry points ensure:

- judgement precedes automation

- trust precedes scale

- governance precedes regret

## **How the Rest of This Guide Is Structured**

From here, the guide moves into **hands-on business practice**, where each domain is treated as an operational lever.

Each domain section will:

- explain **what it protects or enables** in business terms

- show **how to apply it immediately  **

- surface common **commercial failure modes  **

- include a short reflection moment

You can engage with:

- one domain for a specific problem

- several domains for a workflow

- all six domains when stakes are high

## **Stage 3 — Core Practice Workflow: Domains 1–3**

Domains 1–3 determine **whether AI genuinely creates business value or quietly erodes it**.

In entrepreneurial and commercial settings, these domains shape:

- how risk enters your business

- where accountability sits

- whether AI accelerates learning or multiplies bad assumptions

These domains are about **productive use without loss of control**.

## **Domain 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation**

**Knowing What AI Can (and Cannot) Do for Your Business**

### **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects your business from:

- over-claiming capability to customers or investors

- relying on outputs that *sound* commercial but aren’t grounded

- making decisions based on incomplete or fabricated information

- assuming AI understands your market, context, or strategy

AI does not “understand”:

- your positioning

- your customers’ lived realities

- legal or regulatory nuance

- strategic intent

Awareness keeps AI **in its lane**.

### **Apply Now — Business Awareness Questions**

Before you act on AI outputs, ask:

- What data, context, or constraints does this model *not* have?

- Where might it invent plausible but false claims?

- Which outputs could mislead customers, staff, or partners?

- What mistake here would be most expensive?

If you cannot answer these clearly, AI output should be treated as *exploratory only*.

### **Tool in Use — Commercial Awareness Check**

Use this before using AI beyond drafts:

**Commercial Awareness Check**

- This AI is strong at:

- This AI is weak at:

- A commercially damaging error would be:

- This must be verified by a human:

One line each. Precision matters more than completeness.

### **Common Business Failure Modes**

- inventing metrics, testimonials, or customer segments

- overstating certainty in forecasts or claims

- treating generic market advice as strategy

- assuming fluency equals accuracy

### **Quick Reflection**

> *If this output were challenged by a customer or investor, where would it fall apart?*

## **Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency**

**Keeping Commercial Responsibility Where It Belongs**

### **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects:

- founder and leadership accountability

- ethical responsibility toward customers and staff

- clarity of ownership for decisions that affect money or trust

AI can contribute, but:

> **AI cannot carry commercial responsibility.**

**  **

### **Apply Now — Co-Agency Boundary Questions**

Ask explicitly:

- What can AI *suggest* versus what must humans *decide*?

- Where does liability or reputational risk sit?

- Who signs off before anything customer-facing happens?

If the answer is “the model suggested it,” co-agency has failed.

### **Tool in Use — Business Co-Agency Map**

Define roles clearly:

**Business Co-Agency Map**

- AI may support by: drafting, ideation, summarising, comparison

- AI may not: commit, promise, price, hire, fire, or evaluate conclusively

- Human remains accountable for: accuracy, tone, compliance, trust

Keep this visible for your team.

### **Common Business Failure Modes**

- letting AI frame options in persuasive but biased ways

- accepting outputs under pressure to move fast

- attributing poor outcomes to “what the AI said”

**  **

### **Quick Reflection**

> *Could I clearly explain this decision without mentioning AI at all?*

If not, too much judgement has drifted to the system.

## **Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation**

**Using AI to Accelerate Learning — Not Lock in Mistakes**

### **What This Domain Enables**

This domain enables:

- faster iteration and experimentation

- exploration of ideas and alternatives

- cost-effective drafting and synthesis

But innovation is only valuable when:

- mistakes are reversible

- learning is captured

- risks are bounded

### **Apply Now — Safe Business Experimentation Questions**

Before scaling AI use, ask:

- Is this experiment reversible?

- Who will act on the output?

- Could this materially affect customers or revenue?

- What signal tells us to stop or adjust?

If an experiment can change outcomes permanently, it needs governance, not speed.

### **Tool in Use — Safe Experiment Prompt Frame**

When experimenting, constrain AI explicitly:

> *“Generate options or drafts for internal testing.  
> This output will not be used externally or acted on without human review.”*

This language reduces authority creep.

### **Common Business Failure Modes**

- allowing pilots to “quietly become production”

- scaling workflows before validating outputs

- conflating efficiency with improvement

### **Quick Reflection**

> *Am I optimising for short-term output, or long-term business capability?*

**  **

## **Domains 1–3 in Combination — The Business Value Gate**

Before AI influences real business decisions, confirm:

- AI limitations are understood

- human accountability is clear

- experimentation is controlled and reversible

If any condition is missing, pause.

Moving fast is not a virtue if you are moving **blindly**.

### **Transition to Stage 4**

Domains 1–3 answer:

> *Can AI add value safely here?*

Domains 4–6 ask:

> *Should it, and under what ethical, governance, and renewal conditions?*

Stage 4 focuses on:

- trust and equity

- compliance and defensibility

- scaling without reputational collapse

**  **

## **Stage 4 — Risk, Responsibility & Renewal: Domains 4–6**

Domains 4–6 determine whether AI use in business **scales trust or quietly destroys it**.

Most business harm from AI does **not** come from bad intentions.  
It comes from:

- unchecked claims

- subtle bias

- responsibility drift

- decisions no one can later defend

These domains are where **commercial maturity with AI** is demonstrated.

## **Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact**

**Protecting Trust, Customers, and Fairness**

### **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects your business from:

- misleading customers (deliberately or accidentally)

- discriminatory or exclusionary practices

- reputational damage and loss of legitimacy

- backlash, regulatory interest, or legal challenge

In business contexts, ethics is not abstract morality.  
It is about **who pays the price when things go wrong**.

AI can:

- exaggerate benefits

- flatten nuance

- amplify hidden bias

- treat people as segments rather than individuals

Ethical capability ensures growth does not come at others’ expense.

### **Apply Now — Business Ethics Questions**

Before releasing AI-influenced outputs externally, ask:

- Could this mislead or over-promise to customers?

- Are any groups unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged?

- Would the people affected recognise themselves fairly in the output?

- Is consent, transparency, or disclosure required?

- Would we stand by this decision if it became public?

If you hesitate, ethics needs to move earlier in the workflow.

**  **

### **Tool in Use — Commercial Impact & Trust Scan**

Use this rapid scan:

**Business Impact & Trust Scan**

- Customer trust risk:

- Fairness / bias risk:

- Reputational exposure:

- Regulatory or legal sensitivity:

One sentence per risk is sufficient.

### **Common Business Failure Modes**

- inflating claims because “marketing always does”

- assuming efficiency gains justify ethical shortcuts

- treating fairness concerns as “edge cases”

- copying competitors’ AI practices without scrutiny

### **Quick Reflection**

> *If a customer affected by this decision were in the room, what would worry them most?*

**  **

## **Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance**

**Making Commercial AI Use Defensible**

### **What This Domain Protects**

This domain protects:

- founders and leaders from personal liability

- the business from inconsistent or ad-hoc decisions

- credibility with investors, partners, and regulators

- organisational memory as the business scales

Governance is not red tape.  
It is **the minimum structure needed to move fast without losing control**.

### **Apply Now — Business Governance Questions**

Ask:

- Is it clear where AI influenced this decision?

- Who approved its use?

- What assumptions were accepted?

- Could we explain this process to an investor or auditor?

- Would another team make the same decision using this guidance?

If decisions depend on *who happens to be in the room*, governance is missing.

**  **

### **Tool in Use — Business AI Decision Record**

For any meaningful AI-influenced decision, capture:

**Business AI Decision Record**

- Decision being made:

- Business objective:

- Role of AI (support / suggestion / analysis):

- Human decision-maker:

- Risks considered (trust, fairness, compliance):

- Review or escalation required:

This can be lightweight — but it must exist.

### **Governance Triggers (Practical Rules)**

Increase scrutiny or require sign-off when AI affects:

- customer-facing messaging or claims

- hiring, screening, or performance evaluation

- pricing, eligibility, or access decisions

- regulated industries or sensitive data

- brand, reputation, or investor communications

If the impact expands, governance must scale too.

**  **

### **Common Business Failure Modes**

- “We’ll document it later”

- governance existing only in one person’s head

- teams inventing their own AI rules

- decisions justified post-hoc rather than designed

### **Quick Reflection**

> *Could this decision be defended clearly if questioned six months from now?*

## **Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

**Turning AI Use into a Strategic Capability**

### **What This Domain Sustains**

This domain sustains:

- long-term competitive advantage

- ethical and reputational resilience

- adaptive use of AI as tools and markets change

- organisational learning beyond individuals

Without reflection:

- mistakes repeat

- shallow usage patterns harden

- AI becomes noise, not leverage

Renewal is what prevents today’s optimisation from becoming tomorrow’s liability.

### **Apply Now — Business Reflection Questions**

After AI-influenced work, ask:

- What did AI genuinely improve?

- Where did it add friction, confusion, or risk?

- Which assumptions proved false?

- What should we stop doing next time?

- What should we formalise or refine?

If these answers stay implicit, learning is lost.

### **Tool in Use — Business Learning Loop**

Use this loop:

**Reflect → Adjust → Reapply**

- Reflect on outcomes and signals

- Adjust prompts, workflows, or boundaries

- Reapply only what works reliably

Schedule this:

- monthly for startups

- quarterly for established teams

### **Common Business Failure Modes**

- chasing new tools without consolidating learning

- treating failures as embarrassment rather than signal

- ignoring near-misses

- capability living only with one founder

### **Quick Reflection**

> *What business assumption about AI do we need to revisit next?*

## **Domains 4–6 Combined — The Trust & Scale Test**

Before scaling AI use across your business, ensure:

- customer and equity risks are understood and mitigated

- AI-influenced decisions are documented and defensible

- learning cycles are active and shared

If any condition is missing, scaling is premature.

Growth without trust is fragile growth.

**  **

### **Transition to Stage 5**

Stage 5 consolidates everything into:

- a **Business AI Capability Self-Check  **

- a **worked entrepreneurial scenario  **

- a **Business AI Operating Model** you can reuse immediately

This is where capability becomes **portable and durable**.

## **Stage 5 — Capability Self-Check, Worked Business Scenario & Operating Model**

This final stage converts business-oriented AI thinking into a **repeatable operating system**.

You will:

- assess your current business AI capability

- see how all six domains operate together in a commercial scenario

- leave with a **Business AI Operating Model** you can apply immediately

This stage focuses on **speed with safety, and growth with legitimacy**.

**  **

## **PART A — BUSINESS AI CAPABILITY SELF-CHECK**

This self-check is **diagnostic, not evaluative**.

It answers:

> *“Where could our AI use cause harm, confusion, or loss of trust as we grow?”*

Complete in **under five minutes**.

### **Domain 1 — Awareness & Orientation**

Ask:

- I understand how AI generates outputs used in our business

- I know where those outputs are likely to be unreliable

- We avoid making claims we cannot substantiate

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed/no:  **
Restrict AI to internal drafts only.

### **Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency**

Consider:

- Humans retain final authority for decisions affecting customers, staff, and money

- We do not attribute responsibility to AI

- Roles are clear even under pressure

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed/no:  **
Accountability is drifting — address immediately.

### **Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation**

Reflect:

- AI experiments are reversible

- We learn before we scale

- We know which uses actually improve outcomes

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed/no:  **
Innovation may be producing hidden risk.

### **Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact**

Ask:

- Customer and staff trust is protected

- We consider fairness and inclusion impacts

- We pause when harm or misrepresentation is possible

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed/no:  **
Ethical debt is accumulating.

**  **

### **Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance**

Check:

- AI influence is documented

- Decisions can be explained later

- Review and escalation thresholds are known

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed/no:  **
Business defensibility is weak.

### **Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

Finally:

- We deliberately review AI use

- Prompts and practices evolve

- Learning spreads beyond individuals

☐ Mostly yes  ☐ Mixed  ☐ Mostly no

**If mixed/no:  **
Capability will stall.

**  **

### **How to Read Your Results**

- Gaps in **Domains 1–2** → pause customer-facing AI use

- Gaps in **Domains 4–5** → strengthen safeguards before scaling

- Gaps in **Domain 6** → risk repeating mistakes

Business AI capability grows through **design, not accumulation**.

## **PART B — WORKED BUSINESS SCENARIO (END-TO-END)**

A realistic example showing the six domains operating together.

### **Scenario**

A growing B2B consultancy plans to use AI to:

- generate marketing content

- qualify inbound leads

- assist proposal drafting

This affects:

- brand perception

- client trust

- revenue

**  **

### **Domain 1 — Awareness in Action**

Leaders recognise:

- AI can invent metrics or exaggerate success

- Generic positioning may dilute differentiation

They restrict AI to:

- draft generation

- idea exploration

All claims require human verification.

### **Domain 2 — Co-Agency in Action**

Roles are defined:

**AI may:**

- generate outlines

- propose alternative wording

- summarise past work

**AI may not:**

- claim results

- describe clients without consent

- commit pricing or scope

**Humans:**

- own final messaging

- approve every external output

### **Domain 3 — Applied Practice in Action**

The team:

- tests AI outputs internally

- compares with human-only drafts

- uses feedback to refine prompts

Scaling follows **learning**, not novelty.

### **Domain 4 — Ethics & Impact in Action**

Before release, the team checks:

- tone is respectful and accurate

- content does not mislead

- exclusions or assumptions are minimised

They decide where disclosure is appropriate.

### **Domain 5 — Governance in Action**

They create a **Business AI Decision Record**:

- which tasks allow AI support

- who approves outputs

- what reviews are mandatory

This record guides future hires and partners.

### **Domain 6 — Reflection & Renewal in Action**

Monthly reviews capture:

- what AI actually improved

- where it caused confusion or rework

- which practices to stop, standardise, or expand

AI use becomes a managed capability.

### **What This Scenario Shows**

AI contributes to growth when:

- humans remain accountable

- claims remain honest

- learning guides scale

- governance protects trust

This is **business maturity with AI**.

**  **

## **PART C — BUSINESS AI OPERATING MODEL**

This is your **repeatable system**.

Complete once. Revisit as the business grows.

### **1️⃣ Where AI Adds Business Value**

AI supports us in:

### **2️⃣ Non-Negotiable Boundaries**

**AI may:**

### **3️⃣ Trust & Ethics Red Lines**

We pause or stop AI use when:

**  **

### **4️⃣ Decision & Documentation Rules**

We document AI use when it affects:

- customers

- staff

- money

- reputation

Format used:

### **5️⃣ Review & Learning Rhythm**

We review AI use:  
☐ monthly ☐ quarterly ☐ per project

### **6️⃣ Renewal Commitments**

To maintain healthy AI capability, we will:

- revisit assumptions regularly

- update prompts and workflows

- share learning across the team

**  **

## **THE BUSINESS AI COMMITMENT**

> *We use AI to enhance value — not to obscure responsibility.  *
> *We protect trust as a strategic asset.  *
> *We scale learning before we scale automation.  *
> *We renew our practices as our business evolves.*
