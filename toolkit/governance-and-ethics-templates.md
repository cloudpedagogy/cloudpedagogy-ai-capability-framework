## F1. AI Risk Classification Template

### Purpose
Use this template to classify any proposed AI use case according to organisational risk exposure, ethical impact, governance needs, and proportional safeguards.

### Classification Table

| Section | Details to Complete |
|------|---------------------|
| **Title of AI Use Case** | |
| **Business Owner / Academic Lead** | |
| **Primary AI Function** | (e.g. text generation, prediction, summarisation, evaluation, simulation) |
| **Data Involved** | (Describe: personal, confidential, operational, public) |
| **Risk Category** | Low / Moderate / Substantial / High |
| **Reasoning for Classification** | |
| **Required Controls** | (e.g. human-in-the-loop, data restrictions, review cycle, logging) |
| **Sign-Off Required** | Programme Lead / Data Governance / Ethics Lead |

### Risk Category Guidance

| Category | Description | Examples | Required Controls |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Low** | No personal data; low consequence; reversible | General brainstorming; ideation | No approval needed |
| **Moderate** | Some sensitivity; may impact communication or accuracy | Drafting educational materials | Human review required |
| **Substantial** | Potential public impact; data sensitivity | Health communication drafting; student-facing outputs | Governance approval |
| **High** | Legal, ethical, or safety-critical | Predictive analytics on learner data; policy modelling | Senior sign-off + monitoring |

| **Accessibility** | Are outputs usable by diverse learners/stakeholders? | |
| **Cultural Context** | Is the workflow sensitive to local/sector contexts? | |
| **Data Ethics** | What data is used? Is it appropriate, legal, proportionate? | |
