## 1. Introduction to the Case Pack

The **Applied Examples Case Pack** provides concrete, real-world illustrations of how the AI Capability Framework is used across different sectors.

Each example highlights:

- the practical workflow  
- the decisions humans and AI each make  
- ethical and governance considerations  
- how multiple capability domains interact  
- lessons learned and suggested next steps  

These cases are designed for:

- individual learning  
- team workshops  
- induction and training  
- leadership briefings  
- scenario-based planning  

You may adapt these cases for your own sector, team, or organisational context.

### Included in this pack

- **Education** – AI-supported Curriculum Review  
- **Healthcare** – AI-Augmented Patient Communication  
- **Public Services** – Local Government AI Policy Briefing  

These examples reflect the diversity of AI-enabled practice across professional environments.

## 2. Education Case Example  
### AI-Supported Curriculum Review

### Scenario Overview

A university faculty is preparing for a cyclical curriculum review. Staff must evaluate alignment between learning outcomes, assessments, graduate attributes, and external benchmarks. Time is limited, and the review committee wants deeper insight into coherence, progression, and potential duplication.

### AI-Enabled Workflow

1. **Synthesis of existing documentation**  
   AI aggregates module guides, learning outcomes, assessments, rubrics, and feedback summaries.

2. **Coherence analysis**  
   The system identifies redundancies, gaps in progression, and mismatched assessment types.

3. **Scenario modelling**  
   AI generates visual “what-if” models showing how small structural changes (e.g. moving assessments, adjusting prerequisites) affect student progression.

4. **Human interpretation and refinement**  
   Academic leads challenge assumptions, contextualise recommendations, and adjust suggestions based on disciplinary norms.

### Framework Domains in Action

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
  Staff examine system assumptions, data limits, and interpretation boundaries.

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
  Academics retain judgement; AI accelerates synthesis and highlights patterns.

- **Generative Practice & Innovation**  
  Staff explore alternative programme structures and assessment strategies.

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
  Equity concerns emerge: are assessments inclusive? Are some groups disadvantaged?

- **Decision-Making & Governance**  
  The committee documents rationale, oversight roles, and review decisions.

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**  
  Lessons are recorded for future curriculum cycles.

### Lessons Learned

- AI reveals patterns that humans might overlook, but recommendations require contextual interpretation.  
- Transparent logging strengthens internal trust in the process.  
- Equity analysis improves programme design for diverse learners.

### Suggested Adaptation

Use this workflow for smaller tasks such as module redesign, assessment calibration, or short-cycle quality reviews.

## 3. Healthcare Case Example  
### AI-Augmented Patient Communication

### Scenario Overview

A hospital communications team needs to update patient information leaflets across several treatment pathways. Materials must be multilingual, accessible, and medically accurate. Timelines are tight.

### AI-Enabled Workflow

1. **Draft generation**  
   AI produces first-draft patient leaflets in multiple languages at readability level B1.

2. **Clinical validation**  
   Doctors and nurses correct inaccuracies, clarify risk communication, and check medical nuance.

3. **Cultural and accessibility review**  
   A patient advisory group evaluates clarity, tone, and cultural resonance.

4. **Oversight documentation**  
   The team uses a governance log to document where AI contributed, medical sign-off, and patient feedback.

### Framework Domains in Action

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
  Staff examine translation limits and medical safety considerations.

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
  AI drafts; clinicians maintain medical accuracy and safety.  
  Patient groups ensure lived experience remains central.

- **Generative Practice & Innovation**  
  Iterative drafting accelerates multilingual production.

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
  Accessibility and cultural equity are prioritised.

- **Decision-Making & Governance**  
  Clear sign-off chains and risk logs prevent miscommunication.

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**  
  Teams refine templates for future updates.

### Lessons Learned

- Multilingual drafting accelerates production dramatically.  
- Patient involvement identifies usability and cultural gaps AI alone cannot detect.  
- Governance logs reduce liability and strengthen trust.

### Suggested Adaptation

Apply this model to clinical FAQs, onboarding materials, or consent forms.

## 4. Public Services Case Example  
### Local Government AI Policy Briefing

### Scenario Overview

A city council innovation team must prepare a 10-minute policy briefing for elected officials about adopting AI-powered traffic monitoring. They need a rapid, balanced, and transparent overview of opportunities, risks, and governance implications.

### AI-Enabled Workflow

1. **Rapid synthesis of reports**  
   AI summarises evidence, policy precedents, and case studies.

2. **Stakeholder-specific versions**  
   Two briefings are generated:
   - a technical version for engineers  
   - an accessible version for elected officials

3. **Ethics and governance review**  
   AI highlights surveillance risks, bias concerns, and public trust issues; legal teams validate compliance.

4. **Post-briefing learning**  
   The team identifies which AI-generated sections worked and where human framing was essential.

### Framework Domains in Action

- **AI Awareness & Orientation**  
  Staff interrogate assumptions in AI summaries.

- **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
  Humans shape tone, framing, and political sensitivity.

- **Generative Practice & Innovation**  
  AI accelerates discovery and comparative analysis.

- **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
  Community impacts, privacy concerns, and potential harms are evaluated.

- **Decision-Making & Governance**  
  Oversight and compliance checks inform the final recommendation.

- **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**  
  Lessons improve future policy-briefing workflows.

### Lessons Learned

- AI speeds up briefing preparation but cannot substitute political judgement.  
- Transparency about system use increases trust with elected officials.  
- Ethical and governance reviews must occur early, not at the end.

### Suggested Adaptation

Apply this workflow to procurement briefings, public consultations, or strategic planning documents.
