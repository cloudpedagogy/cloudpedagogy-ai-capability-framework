## 1. Purpose of This Toolkit

The **AI Interaction and Design Toolkit** provides structured methods for designing effective, transparent, and ethically aligned interactions with AI systems. It supports users in:

- shaping inputs and configurations intentionally  
- understanding how systems generate outputs  
- maintaining human oversight and interpretability  
- embedding values such as equity, transparency, and accountability  
- creating auditable, repeatable workflows for AI use  

This toolkit applies across **text, image, multimodal, agentic, predictive, and emerging AI systems**.

---

## 2. How to Use This Toolkit

Use this toolkit to:

- design workflows for AI-supported tasks  
- document prompts, decisions, and oversight  
- analyse system behaviour  
- ensure responsible integration of AI into teaching, research, governance, or public-service contexts  

Each domain includes **design goals, considerations, and template statements** you may adapt directly.

## 3. Interaction and Design Templates by Domain

---

### Domain 1 – AI Awareness and Orientation

**Design Goal:** Support transparent understanding of how outputs are produced.

**Key Considerations:**

- What system type is being used (predictive, generative, agentic, multimodal)?  
- What data and assumptions shape its outputs?  
- How can reasoning or uncertainty be made visible?

**Design Templates:**

- “Explain how this system reached its conclusion. Identify key data, rules, or assumptions.”  
- “Highlight uncertainty or sources of potential bias in this output.”  
- “Compare this system’s reasoning with a human expert’s interpretation. Describe similarities and differences.”  
- “Outline what information would improve the accuracy or fairness of this output.”

**Purpose:** Build epistemic transparency into interactions to strengthen trust and interpretability.

---

### Domain 2 – Human–AI Co-Agency

**Design Goal:** Clarify roles, boundaries, and responsibilities in shared tasks.

**Key Considerations:**

- Which decisions remain human-led?  
- How do we record authorship and oversight?  
- Where is ethical or contextual validation required?

**Design Templates:**

- “Collaborate with me on the following task; I will review each step and provide context.”  
- “Identify points where human judgement or ethical review is required.”  
- “Provide alternative options reflecting different human priorities or values.”  
- “Record which elements of this output were AI-generated and which require human validation.”

**Purpose:** Ensure AI augments human expertise rather than replacing or obscuring it.

---

### Domain 3 – Applied Practice and Innovation

**Design Goal:** Enable responsible experimentation, ideation, and rapid prototyping.

**Key Considerations:**

- What outcome are we exploring?  
- How do we keep prototypes transparent and reversible?  
- What ethical and downstream impacts must be considered during innovation?

**Design Templates:**

- “Generate three approaches to this problem, with trade-offs for each.”  
- “Design a prototype workflow and indicate where human feedback is required.”  
- “List potential unintended consequences or downstream effects of this proposed design.”  
- “Propose alternative versions that increase inclusivity or accessibility.”

**Purpose:** Encourage creative exploration while maintaining ethical diligence.

---

### Domain 4 – Ethics, Equity and Impact

**Design Goal:** Identify, prevent, and mitigate exclusion, harm, or structural bias.

**Key Considerations:**

- Who benefits or is disadvantaged by this system?  
- Are marginalised perspectives represented?  
- Does the AI reinforce or disrupt inequity?

**Design Templates:**

- “Identify potential equity risks within this workflow and propose mitigations.”  
- “Analyse how this output might affect different stakeholder groups.”  
- “Simulate a multi-perspective debate on ethical implications.”  
- “Generate inclusion and accessibility guidelines for using this AI system in this context.”

**Purpose:** Build justice-oriented, anticipatory ethics into the design process.

---

### Domain 5 – Decision-Making and Governance

**Design Goal:** Ensure decisions involving AI are transparent, explainable, and accountable.

**Key Considerations:**

- What decisions are automated, assisted, or reviewed?  
- What documentation is required for auditability?  
- Who has authority to validate, challenge, or overturn system recommendations?

**Design Templates:**

- “Create a decision map showing each stage where AI input occurs and who validates it.”  
- “Draft an audit log documenting data sources, model lineage, and reasoning steps.”  
- “Provide three governance options and outline risks, benefits, and oversight mechanisms for each.”  
- “Identify where human sign-off is required and record justification.”

**Purpose:** Translate governance principles into concrete, operational mechanisms.

---

### Domain 6 – Reflection, Learning and Renewal

**Design Goal:** Embed reflection, feedback, and iteration into AI-enabled work.

**Key Considerations:**

- How do we track system performance over time?  
- What evidence informs refinements?  
- How is learning shared across teams?

**Design Templates:**

- “Review the last five interactions. Identify patterns, gaps, or recurring biases.”  
- “Create a reflection log summarising insights and next steps.”  
- “Design a periodic review process for evaluating system effectiveness and risk.”  
- “Recommend adjustments to improve transparency, fairness, or usability.”

**Purpose:** Support continuous improvement and adaptive learning across systems and teams.

## 6. Good Practice Principles for Interaction Design

- **Intentionality:** Align design choices with purpose and values.  
- **Transparency:** Make assumptions, data origins, and reasoning traceable.  
- **Relationality:** Treat interaction as partnership, not delegation.  
- **Accountability:** Document oversight and decision authority.  
- **Iteration:** Review and refine interactions regularly.
