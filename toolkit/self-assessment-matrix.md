## 1. Purpose of This Worksheet

This worksheet allows you to map your current capability across the six domains of the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition).

It is designed for:

- individual reflection  
- team discussions  
- capability reviews  
- CPD planning  
- institutional benchmarking  

Use this worksheet before, during, and after applying the Framework. It can be repeated every **3–6 months** to track development.

## 2. How to Use This Worksheet

1. Read each domain descriptor (**Emerging → Developing → Proficient → Advanced**).  
2. Circle or highlight the level that best describes you or your team.  
3. Write brief notes explaining your choice.  
4. Identify up to three priority areas for growth.  
5. Use the action-planning table at the end to record next steps.

> There are **no scores**. This is developmental, not evaluative.

## 3. Domain-by-Domain Self-Assessment

---

### Domain 1 – AI Awareness & Orientation

**Guiding question:**  
What do we understand about how AI systems perceive, reason, and decide?

**Select your current level:**

- **Emerging** – My understanding is surface-level; I rely on media or tool-specific narratives.  
- **Developing** – I understand basic concepts (models, data sources, bias, limitations).  
- **Proficient** – I critically interpret AI outputs, question assumptions, and understand provenance.  
- **Advanced** – I mentor others; I articulate epistemic assumptions and interpretability concerns.

**Notes (e.g. evidence, examples, uncertainty):**

### Domain 2 – Human–AI Co-Agency

**Guiding question:**  
How do I design and document meaningful human–AI partnerships?

**Select your current level:**

- **Emerging** – I use AI without clear purpose or human oversight.  
- **Developing** – I distinguish what tasks should remain human-led.  
- **Proficient** – I define roles and responsibilities clearly in AI-enabled workflows.  
- **Advanced** – I lead co-agency design and document accountability practices.

**Notes:**

### Domain 3 – Applied Practice & Innovation

**Guiding question:**  
How do I experiment and create with AI responsibly?

**Select your current level:**

- **Emerging** – I use AI occasionally, mostly for efficiency.  
- **Developing** – I experiment in low-risk areas and refine through trial and error.  
- **Proficient** – I use AI for creative problem-solving and transparent prototyping.  
- **Advanced** – I lead inclusive, ethical innovation and share learning widely.

### Domain 4 – Ethics, Equity & Impact

**Guiding question:**  
How do I anticipate and mitigate harm, bias, or exclusion?

**Select your current level:**

- **Emerging** – Ethical issues are not part of my workflow.  
- **Developing** – I recognise bias and fairness concerns.  
- **Proficient** – I integrate equity checks and foresight into decisions.  
- **Advanced** – I lead systemic ethical practice and fairness reviews.

### Domain 5 – Decision-Making & Governance

**Guiding question:**  
How do I ensure transparent and accountable AI-supported decisions?

**Select your current level:**

- **Emerging** – I accept outputs without review or documentation.  
- **Developing** – I recognise where AI influences decisions and begin oversight.  
- **Proficient** – I implement explainable decision workflows and documentation.  
- **Advanced** – I help design governance structures and oversight mechanisms.

### Domain 6 – Reflection, Learning & Renewal

**Guiding question:**  
How do I embed learning loops and adapt AI use over time?

**Select your current level:**

- **Emerging** – Reflection happens infrequently or informally.  
- **Developing** – I discuss lessons learned after projects or experiments.  
- **Proficient** – I maintain structured reflection logs and review practices.  
- **Advanced** – I support team- or organisation-wide learning ecosystems.
