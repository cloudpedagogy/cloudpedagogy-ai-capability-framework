# **AI Capability Framework — Quick Reference Guide for Course Designers**

### ***How to Design Practical, Responsible, and Innovative AI Courses in Any Domain***

**CloudPedagogy (2026 Edition)**



# **1. THE SIX DOMAINS (ESSENTIAL SUMMARY FOR DESIGN)**

|  |  |  |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Domain** | **Capability** | **When It Matters in Course Design** |
| **1. Awareness & Orientation** | Understanding AI behaviour, accuracy limits, misinformation | Every course needs a foundational “understanding AI” module |
| **2. Human–AI Co-Agency** | Structuring human–AI responsibilities | When designing workflows, prompting, or drafting tasks |
| **3. Generative Practice & Innovation** | Prototyping, creating, iterating | When learners must create content, explore ideas, or simulate scenarios |
| **4. Ethics, Equity & Impact** | Avoiding harm, ensuring fairness, critical evaluation | Any context with public communication, sensitive topics, or vulnerable groups |
| **5. Decision-Making & Governance** | Oversight, documentation, safe boundaries | When AI decisions affect real people, data, or public outputs |
| **6. Reflection, Learning & Renewal** | Reviewing decisions, improving over time | Every course’s final module or reflective practice element |

**Design rule:**

> Every course must have **six modules**, each aligned to one domain.



# **2. THE UNIVERSAL 7-STEP COURSE DESIGN METHOD**

Use this method every time you design a new CloudPedagogy course.

### **STEP 1 — Define Purpose & Learner Needs**

- Who is the course for?

- What real-world challenges do they face?

- What capability growth is needed?

### **STEP 2 — Identify 3–6 Real Use Cases**

Focus only on *practical tasks*.  
Example: “Draft a climate explainer” or “Review public health messaging.”

### **STEP 3 — Map Use Cases to the Six Domains**

Each use case must clearly map to:

- A **primary domain**

- One or more **secondary domains**

### **STEP 4 — Convert Domains into Practical Modules**

*Avoid* naming modules after domains.  
Instead use practical titles:

- “Co-Writing Climate Communications with AI”

- “Ethical AI for Public Health Messaging”



### **STEP 5 — Use the 3+1+1 Lesson Structure**

Each module contains:

- **3 applied lessons**

- **1 hands-on activity**

- **1 downloadable template/tool**

### **STEP 6 — Build Cross-Domain Links**

Ensure the course has:

- Awareness → Co-Agency

- Co-Agency → Innovation

- Innovation → Ethics

- Ethics → Governance

- Governance → Reflection

### **STEP 7 — Validate with the Six-Domain Checklist**

The course is complete only when all domains have been addressed fully and responsibly.



# **3. THE SIGNATURE COURSE STRUCTURE TEMPLATE**

Use this in all CloudPedagogy courses.

MODULE 1 — Awareness (Domain 1)

Lesson 1

Lesson 2

Lesson 3

Activity

Download

MODULE 2 — Co-Agency (Domain 2)

MODULE 3 — Generative Practice (Domain 3)

MODULE 4 — Ethics & Equity (Domain 4)

MODULE 5 — Governance (Domain 5)

MODULE 6 — Reflection (Domain 6)

Total course time (free course): 2–3 hours  
Total course time (paid version): 5–7 hours or 30–40k words



# **4. LESSON DESIGN QUICK TEMPLATE**

**Lesson Title:** Practical, action-focused  
**Module / Domain:  **
**Outcome:** What capability does the learner gain?  
**Real-World Task:** What it prepares them to do  
**Structure:**

1.  *Concept* — short, clear explanation

2.  *Demonstration* — model output, example workflow

3.  *Application* — guided practice

4.  *Reflection* — quick self-check

**Ethical/EQUITY Note:**
List one risk or bias to check for.

**Outputs:**
What the learner will produce during the lesson.



# **5. ACTIVITY DESIGN QUICK TEMPLATE**

Every module has **one activity**.  
Activities must be:

- hands-on

- practical

- output-focused

- aligned to the domain

### **Activity Format:**

1.  Task description

2.  Instructions (step-by-step)

3.  AI + Human roles (co-agency)

4.  Risks and checks

5.  Output to submit or save

**Examples:**

- Evaluate an AI-generated climate advisory

- Co-write a sustainability message

- Prototype a health explainer

- Audit a humanitarian scenario

- Create a governance flow

- Run a retrospective

# **6. DOWNLOADABLE TOOL QUICK BUILDER**

Every module must include one downloadable resource:

- Glossary

- Prompt pack

- Co-agency matrix

- Ethical checklist

- Governance log

- Reflection worksheet

The download should:

- be actionable

- be reusable

- support real work beyond the course



# **7. ETHICAL & EQUITY QUICK CHECK (DOMAIN 4)**

Before finalising content:

☐ Have we checked for misinformation or hallucinations?  
☐ Are vulnerable groups represented fairly?  
☐ Are cultural assumptions avoided?  
☐ Is the messaging responsible and non-harmful?  
☐ Is human authorship clear?  
☐ Have we included transparency guidance?

If any box is unticked, revise before publishing.

# **8. GOVERNANCE QUICK CHECK (DOMAIN 5)**

☐ Are decision boundaries defined?  
☐ Does the activity or lesson require human review?  
☐ Is the risk category clear?  
☐ Is there an escalation path?  
☐ Is the workflow documented?

If outputs affect real people, governance must be explicit.



# **9. REFLECTION QUICK CHECK (DOMAIN 6)**

Each module must support:

- self-reflection

- improvement cycles

- prompting refinement

- workflow revision

Each course must include:

- at least one retrospective

- one reflection worksheet

- instructions for updating practice

This is the design spine behind every CloudPedagogy course.

# **11. WHEN DESIGNING, ALWAYS CHECK:**

### **✔ Is the course practical?**

Does it solve real tasks?

### **✔ Is it innovative?**

Does it include prototyping, ideation, multimodal creation?

### **✔ Is it responsible?**

Does it include ethics, equity, governance, and reflection?

### **✔ Is it engaging?**

Are lessons interactive, scenario-based, and hands-on?

If all four are yes → the course is aligned with CloudPedagogy standards.
