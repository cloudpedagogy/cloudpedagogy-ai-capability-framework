# **AI Capability Framework Application Handbook — Executive Summary**

### ***A Practical Method for Designing Responsible, Innovative, and Future-Ready AI Courses***

**CloudPedagogy \| 2026 Edition**

## **Purpose of this Handbook**

This Handbook provides a **practical, step-by-step method** for transforming the *CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)* into fully designed, engaging AI-enabled courses.

It connects three layers:

> **Framework (theory)** → **Handbook (method)** → **Courses (practice)**

It exists to help educators, NGOs, public sector teams, and HE institutions build **safe, responsible, and creative AI capability at scale**.

**  **

## **The Six Domains at a Glance**

1.  **Awareness & Orientation  **
    AI literacy, accuracy checks, recognising hallucinations and misinformation.

2.  **Human–AI Co-Agency  **
    Clear workflows, role boundaries, and human-in-the-loop design.

3.  **Generative Practice & Innovation  **
    Prototyping, creative experimentation, scenario exploration.

4.  **Ethics, Equity & Impact  **
    Bias mitigation, harm avoidance, inclusion, transparency.

5.  **Decision-Making & Governance  **
    Oversight, documentation, escalation protocols, accountability.

6.  **Reflection, Learning & Renewal  **
    Feedback loops, reflective practice, continual improvement.

These domains work as an **integrated capability system**, not isolated skills.

**  **

## **The Universal 7-Step Application Method**

A simple, replicable method for designing responsible and practical AI courses.

1.  **Define the purpose & learner needs  **
    Identify real-world problems and capability gaps.

2.  **Identify real-world use cases & risks  **
    Select 3–6 tasks where AI can assist.

3.  **Map use cases to the Six Domains  **
    Align domain logic to real practice.

4.  **Translate domains into practical modules  **
    Six modules, each grounded in one domain.

5.  **Use the universal lesson structure  **
    3 applied lessons + 1 activity + 1 downloadable per module.

6.  **Build cross-domain links  **
    Ensure ethics, governance, co-agency, and reflection flow through every module.

7.  **Validate using the AI Capability Checklist  **
    Confirm the course is practical, responsible, and aligned to the Framework.

**  **

## **Worked Example: Climate Change & Sustainability**

The Handbook demonstrates the full application method through a complete course example.

**Modules:**

- M1: Understanding Climate Information with GenAI

- M2: Co-Writing Climate Communications with AI

- M3: Prototyping Climate Engagement Materials

- M4: Ethical & Just Climate AI Practice

- M5: AI Governance in Climate Workflows

- M6: Reflective AI Practice for Climate Action

**Why climate?**

- Universal relevance

- Clear, intuitive mapping to all six domains

- Strong public engagement need

- Direct risks of misinformation

- Safe, pedagogically clean example

The example illustrates how any domain—health, humanitarian action, research, policy—can be built using the same method.

**  **

## **Tools & Templates Included**

The Handbook provides fillable tools for instant application:

- Six-Domain Course Builder

- Lesson Designer Template

- Ethical & Equity Checklist

- Human–AI Co-Agency Workflow Template

- Governance Log Template

- Reflection Cycle Worksheet

- Prompt Library for Course Designers

- Visual Framework → Course Mapping Diagrams

These ensure **consistency, quality, and responsibility** across all courses.

**  **

## **Intended Uses**

This Handbook is designed for:

- educators creating AI-enabled teaching materials

- NGOs building AI literacy for field teams

- public health and climate communication units

- digital education teams in higher education

- organisational capability-building initiatives

- internal training and governance groups

- course creators using CloudPedagogy templates

It supports both **individual designers** and **institution-wide adoption**.

**  **

## **The CloudPedagogy Ecosystem**

This Handbook forms part of a connected suite:

- **AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)  **

- **Application Handbook (this)  **

- **Universal AI Practice Workbook  **

- **Prompt Design Toolkit  **

- **Governance & Ethics Templates  **

## **Closing Message**

The AI Capability Framework Application Handbook is designed to help educators, practitioners, and organisations move beyond “tool training” toward **mature, ethical, creative AI capability**.

By using the Framework and the Universal Method, anyone can design courses that are:

- practical

- responsible

- innovative

- engaging

- aligned with public-good values

This Executive Summary captures the essence.
