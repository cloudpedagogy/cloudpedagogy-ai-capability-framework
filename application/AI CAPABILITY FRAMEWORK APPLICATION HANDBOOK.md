# **SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION**

# **1.1 Purpose of This Handbook**

The **AI Capability Framework Application Handbook** is designed to bridge the gap between:

- **The AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** — a 50-page conceptual and developmental structure; and

- **Real-world, practical AI courses and training programmes** across climate action, humanitarian response, higher education, public health, research, and public services.

While the Framework defines *what* responsible, creative, and ethical AI capability looks like, this Handbook explains *how to apply it* step by step.

Its purpose is to:

- provide a replicable **course creation method  **

- demonstrate the full **translation from domain → module → lesson → activity → downloadable  **

- show how to design learning that is **engaging, practical, innovative, and responsible  **

- give educators and organisations a **ready-made system** for building AI literacy and capability at scale

- demonstrate the method using a complete worked example: **Generative AI for Climate Change & Sustainability  **

This handbook is deliberately **application-focused**: it shows how to design courses **from the Framework**, not merely about the Framework.

**  **

# **1.2 How This Handbook Complements the AI Capability Framework**

The 50-page Framework is foundational: it articulates the **six domains** of AI capability and the developmental logic underlying safe, intentional, and mature use of Generative AI.

However, practitioners, instructional designers, and domain experts often ask:

- *“How do we turn the Framework into an actionable course?”  *

- *“How do we apply the six domains in specific areas such as climate, health, research, or teaching?”  *

- *“How do we design activities and assessments that reflect the Framework’s principles?”  *

- *“What does a course built on this Framework actually look like?”  *

This handbook answers those questions.

It acts as the **middle layer** of the ecosystem:

> **AI Capability Framework → Application Handbook → Practical Applied Courses**

This structure ensures consistency, quality, responsibility, and creativity across all CloudPedagogy courses.

**  **

# **1.3 Who This Handbook Is For**

This Handbook is designed for:

### **Educators & Instructional Designers**

Creating curriculum, microcredentials, workshops, and CPD programmes.

### **Humanitarian, Climate, and Public Health Practitioners**

Adapting AI to urgent, mission-driven domains with ethical complexity.

### **Researchers & Analysts**

Using AI responsibly for synthesis, writing, and modelling.

### **Policy Professionals & Public Sector Workers**

Building safe, transparent, and equitable AI-enabled workflows.

### **AI Literacy Leads & Organisational Innovators**

Implementing large-scale capability-building initiatives using a structured developmental approach.

### **Students & Lifelong Learners**

Understanding *how* AI courses are built and how responsible AI practice works in multiple domains.

**  **

# **1.4 Why Climate Change & Sustainability Was Chosen as the Worked Example**

Several factors make climate change the **ideal primary example** for demonstrating the application process:

### **✔ Universality**

Climate change affects all sectors and all learners, regardless of background.

### **✔ Accessibility**

Learners generally understand the basics of climate issues, reducing cognitive load.

### **✔ Clear Mapping to All Six Domains**

Climate communication, misinformation, public engagement, and scenario planning naturally activate all six domains.

### **✔ Low Ethical Risk**

Compared to humanitarian crises, climate content is easier to demonstrate ethically and safely.

### **✔ Engagement**

Climate topics naturally lend themselves to visually rich, practical, and innovative GenAI use cases.

This makes the climate example both **practical** and **pedagogically clean**, allowing the reader to clearly understand the Framework-to-course translation.

**  **

# **1.5 How to Use This Handbook**

Readers can use this handbook in several ways:

- **As a practical method** for designing new AI-enabled courses

- **As a study guide** to understand how the Framework is applied

- **As a quality assurance tool** to evaluate the maturity of existing AI training

- **As an internal design system** for CloudPedagogy course creation

- **As a partner-facing tool** to demonstrate professional methodology

- **As a template** for domain-specific handbooks (e.g., AI in Public Health, AI in Research)

Each section builds systematically:

1.  Summary of the Framework

2.  Universal application method

3.  Full worked example

4.  Supplementary examples

5.  Tools and templates

6.  Next steps

**  **

# **1.6 The Practical and Responsible AI Imperative**

Across all sectors, organisations face a dual challenge:

1.  **Rapidly scaling AI adoption**, and

2.  **Doing so responsibly, ethically, and strategically.  **

This requires a learning system that is:

- practical enough for general users

- rigorous enough for professional environments

- ethical enough for public-good work

- innovative enough to keep pace with AI developments

- structured enough to ensure consistency across programmes

The **AI Capability Framework**, combined with this **Application Handbook**, provides that system.

It enables organisations to move from:

- **Tool use** to **capability development  **

- **Ad hoc experimentation** to **structured innovation  **

- **Individual improvisation** to **institutional strategy  **

- **Risk-prone adoption** to **safeguarded, ethical design  **

This Handbook embodies CloudPedagogy’s core mission:  
**to transform how individuals and organisations build AI capability — responsibly, creatively, and with purpose.**

# **SECTION 2 — THE SIX-DOMAIN AI CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK (SUMMARY RECAP)**

This section provides a **concise, practical recap** of the Six Domains from the *CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)*.  
It is **not** a rewrite of the full 50-page Framework — instead, it highlights the essential components necessary for applying the Framework to course design.

The goal is to give readers a **clear, working understanding** of the domains so they can follow the universal method and the climate example later in the handbook.

**  **

# **2.1 Overview of the Six Domains**

The **AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** defines six interrelated domains that form the foundation of responsible, creative, and impactful AI use. Each domain represents a **distinct capability**, yet all domains work together to support mature, ethical, and context-sensitive AI practice.

Below is a high-level summary of each domain.

## **DOMAIN 1 — Awareness & Orientation**

**Core Capability:** Understanding how AI systems work, what they can and cannot do, and how to interpret AI outputs.  
**Focus Areas:**

- Basic AI literacy (LLMs, data, model behaviour)

- Misinformation recognition

- Identifying hallucinations and uncertainty

- Assessing relevance, accuracy, and reliability

- Recognising when AI is inappropriate or risky

**Why it matters:  **
Domain 1 provides the foundation for every other part of the learning journey. Without awareness and orientation, learners cannot engage in safe or effective AI use.

**  **

## **DOMAIN 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency**

**Core Capability:** Designing intentional partnerships between human judgement and AI assistance.  
**Focus Areas:**

- Identifying tasks suitable for AI support vs. human control

- Constructing responsible prompting strategies

- Human-in-the-loop workflows

- Defining roles, responsibilities, and boundaries

- Maintaining accountability over AI-assisted outputs

**Why it matters:  **
Co-agency prevents over-reliance on AI, clarifies responsibilities, and ensures the human remains the decision-maker.

## **DOMAIN 3 — Generative Practice & Innovation**

**Core Capability:** Using AI to create, prototype, iterate, and innovate in practical tasks.  
**Focus Areas:**

- Creative content generation

- Drafting, prototyping, iteration cycles

- Scenario exploration and ideation

- Multimodal experimentation (text, images, data, etc.)

- Safe-to-fail experimentation in low-risk contexts

**Why it matters:  **
Domain 3 enables learners to use AI *constructively* — for creativity, prototyping, and improved productivity — rather than passively or mechanically.

## **DOMAIN 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact**

**Core Capability:** Evaluating the ethical, equitable, and societal implications of AI use.  
**Focus Areas:**

- Bias detection and mitigation

- Equity audits

- Ethical risk identification

- Anticipating unintended consequences

- Ensuring inclusivity and accessibility

- Avoiding harm, misrepresentation, or exclusion

**Why it matters:  **
This domain ensures that innovation does not come at the expense of fairness, transparency, or vulnerable populations.

## **DOMAIN 5 — Decision-Making & Governance**

**Core Capability:** Applying governance structures, oversight mechanisms, and decision protocols to AI-enabled work.  
**Focus Areas:**

- Decision logs

- AI use statements

- Escalation protocols

- Risk thresholds

- Accountability frameworks

- When to seek human review or expert oversight

**Why it matters:  **
Domain 5 strengthens institutional trust and transparency, ensuring AI use is predictable, documented, and appropriately governed.

## **DOMAIN 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

**Core Capability:** Developing reflective and adaptive AI practices through iterative learning loops.  
**Focus Areas:**

- Reviewing AI outputs and decisions

- Continuous improvement cycles

- Peer feedback and learning communities

- Updating approaches based on new insights or risks

- Critical self-evaluation of AI use

**Why it matters:  **
Domain 6 supports long-term capability development, preventing stagnation and ensuring sustainable, responsible practice.

**  **

# **2.2 How the Domains Interact as a System**

The six domains function as an **ecological system**, not a linear progression.

### **Key relationships:**

- **Domain 1 → enables → Domain 2 & 3  **
  You cannot co-design or innovate with AI without foundational awareness.

- **Domain 2 → moderates → Domain 3  **
  Co-agency ensures generative practice remains safe, intentional, and aligned with human oversight.

- **Domain 4 → sits across ALL domains  **
  Ethics, equity, and harm avoidance influence every use of AI.

- **Domain 5 → governs → the whole system  **
  Governance structures guide safe use, documentation, and accountability.

- **Domain 6 → reinforces → continuous improvement  **
  Reflection ensures that mistakes turn into learning and practice evolves over time.

This illustration shows:

- cyclical reinforcement

- cross-domain interaction

- the centrality of ethics and governance

- reflection as a continuous feedback loop

# **2.3 Why This Framework Is Ideal for Course and Programme Design**

When designing AI-enabled learning, generic “tool training” fails because:

- it does not teach responsibility

- it does not build durable skills

- it does not scale across contexts

- it becomes obsolete when tools change

- it leaves learners exposed to risks

The AI Capability Framework solves these issues by embedding:

### **✔ practical competence**

### **✔ responsible practice**

### **✔ creative innovation**

### **✔ ethical grounding**

### **✔ governance literacy**

### **✔ reflective habits**

Together, they provide a **holistic developmental spine** for course creation.

This means every course designed using the Framework is:

- practical

- safe

- meaningful

- creative

- aligned with organisational values

- adaptable

- future-proof

This handbook shows exactly how to achieve this.

**  **

# **2.4 Core Principles Guiding Responsible AI Practice**

The Framework is grounded in the following principles:

### **1. Human-centred design**

Human judgement remains central.

### **2. Transparency and clarity**

AI-assisted decisions must be traceable and explainable.

### **3. Ethical foresight**

Consideration of equity, harm, and unintended consequences is non-negotiable.

### **4. Innovation with responsibility**

Encourage creativity while maintaining safeguards.

### **5. Contextual sensitivity**

AI use must match the needs and risks of the domain (e.g., climate, humanitarian, health).

### **6. Continuous learning**

AI capability grows through practice, reflection, and adaptation.

These principles shape the methodology described in the next section.

**  **

# **2.5 Visual Map: From Domains to Applied Learning Design**

To support course designers, the following visual summarises how each domain aligns to a specific module focus:

Domain 1 → Foundation Skills

Domain 2 → Workflow Clarity

Domain 3 → Generative Creation

Domain 4 → Ethics & Justice

Domain 5 → Governance & Oversight

Domain 6 → Reflection & Improvement

This mapping becomes the basis for the **Universal Application Method** in Section 3 and the **Climate Course Example** in Section 4.

**  **

# **SECTION 3 — THE UNIVERSAL APPLICATION METHOD (STEP-BY-STEP)**

This is the most important methodological section in the Handbook.  
Here, you will find a **clear, replicable, seven-step process** that transforms the Six-Domain AI Capability Framework into a **fully structured, practical, engaging course** in any domain.

This method is designed to be:

- **Simple** (any educator or practitioner can use it)

- **Flexible** (works for climate, health, humanitarian, education, research, policy, etc.)

- **Scalable** (usable across all CloudPedagogy courses)

- **Responsible** (built on ethics, co-agency, governance)

- **Innovative** (encourages creativity and prototyping)

- **Practical** (outputs are hands-on, activity-based learning experiences)

By following these seven steps, you can build any new course directly from the Framework.

**  **

# **3.1 STEP 1 — DEFINE THE PURPOSE AND LEARNER NEEDS**

  
Before mapping domains or designing lessons, clarify:

### **A. The Problem Space**

Identify the real-world challenges your course must support.  
Examples:

- Climate misinformation

- Humanitarian translation bottlenecks

- Health communication challenges

- Research writing pressures

- Higher-ed assessment redesign

### **B. The Target Learners**

Define:

- Who they are

- Their current AI literacy

- Their roles and constraints

- Their existing practices

- Their risk exposure

**  **

### **C. The Intended Capability Growth**

Use capability language:

- foundational literacy

- workflow design

- generative prototyping

- ethical reasoning

- governance judgement

- reflective practice

This anchors the course in *capability development*, not tool use.

**  **

# **3.2 STEP 2 — IDENTIFY REAL-WORLD USE CASES AND RISKS**

  
Collect 3–6 **typical tasks** in the chosen domain that AI could support.

Examples from climate:

- Summarising climate science for the public

- Detecting misinformation

- Drafting sustainability reports

- Generating climate education materials

- Exploring local adaptation scenarios

Then identify **risks**:

- hallucinations

- biased content

- overconfidence

- ethical misframing

- unjust impacts

- misinterpretation of data

- harmful simplification

This creates the **use-case foundation** for the entire course.

**  **

# **3.3 STEP 3 — MAP USE CASES TO THE SIX DOMAINS**

  
Using a simple mapping table, link each real-world use case to the most relevant domain.

Example (for climate):

|  |  |  |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Real-World Task** | **Primary Domain** | **Secondary Domains** |
| Fact-checking climate content | Domain 1 | Domain 4 |
| Co-writing climate comms | Domain 2 | Domain 3 |
| Prototyping climate education materials | Domain 3 | Domain 2 |
| Reviewing justice implications | Domain 4 | Domain 5 |
| When to trust AI in climate briefing | Domain 5 | Domain 1 |
| Reflecting on AI-assisted outputs | Domain 6 | Domain 2 |

This creates a **blueprint** for the course.

**  **

# **3.4 STEP 4 — TRANSLATE DOMAINS INTO PRACTICAL MODULES**

  
Each of the six domains becomes one **practical module**.

The trick:  
Module titles should always be **practical, action-oriented, applied**, not theoretical.

### **Examples (Climate):**

- Domain 1 → *Understanding Climate Information with AI  *

- Domain 2 → *Co-Writing Climate Communications with AI  *

- Domain 3 → *Prototyping Climate Engagement Materials  *

- Domain 4 → *Ethical and Just Climate AI Practice  *

- Domain 5 → *AI Governance in Climate Workflows  *

- Domain 6 → *Reflective AI Practice for Climate Action  *

Course designers repeat this process for ANY domain:

- Public Health

- Humanitarian Response

- Research

- Education

- Policy

- Environmental Science

- Social Sciences

- Sustainability

This ensures **practicality**, **domain relevance**, and **capability alignment**.

# **3.5 STEP 5 — USE THE UNIVERSAL LESSON STRUCTURE**

  
Each module should contain:

### **✔ Three applied lessons**

Each lesson focuses on a hands-on skill:

1.  Skill: Understanding

2.  Skill: Co-working

3.  Skill: Creating / Iterating OR Evaluating / Governing

### **✔ One hands-on activity**

The practical application of the domain:

- evaluate

- generate

- prototype

- audit

- design

- govern

- reflect

### **✔ One downloadable tool**

Aligned to the domain:

- Glossary

- Co-agency matrix

- Prompt pack

- Ethics checklist

- Governance log

- Reflection worksheet

This is the **CloudPedagogy signature pattern**.

**  **

# **3.6 STEP 6 — BUILD RESPONSIBLE AND INNOVATIVE CROSS-DOMAIN LINKS**

  
A good course doesn’t treat domains as silos.  
You need explicit connections:

### **Link 1 — Awareness → Co-Agency**

Students must understand risks before collaborating with AI.

### **Link 2 — Co-Agency → Generative Practice**

Good workflows lead to better innovation.

### **Link 3 — Generative Practice → Ethics**

Every creative output needs review:

- bias

- cultural accuracy

- climate justice

- equity

### **Link 4 — Ethics → Governance**

If risk is high, an escalation protocol is needed.

### **Link 5 — Governance → Reflection**

Governance logs feed reflection cycles.

### **Link 6 — Reflection → Renewal**

Learners update prompts, workflows, and mental models.

This creates a **holistic learning ecosystem**.

# **3.7 STEP 7 — VALIDATE YOUR COURSE USING THE FRAMEWORK CHECKLIST**

  
Before publishing, assess:

### **Domain 1 — Awareness**

- Are learners taught to identify AI errors?

- Are hallucinations addressed?

### **Domain 2 — Co-Agency**

- Are humans clearly the primary decision-makers?

- Are roles explicit in workflows?

### **Domain 3 — Generative Practice**

- Do learners prototype something real?

- Are outputs iterated and improved?

### **Domain 4 — Ethics & Equity**

- Are risks identified and mitigated?

- Do learners consider fairness and justice?

**  **

### **Domain 5 — Governance**

- Are decision logs or oversight tools included?

- Is the escalation pathway clear?

### **Domain 6 — Reflection**

- Are learners given a reflection task?

- Do they learn how to improve their AI practice?

If all six are met, the course is:

- responsible

- engaging

- practical

- innovative

- aligned with CloudPedagogy standards

# **SECTION 4 — WORKED EXAMPLE: GENERATIVE AI FOR CLIMATE CHANGE & SUSTAINABILITY**

  
This section demonstrates **the full translation** from:

> **AI Capability Framework → Application Method → Real Course Design**

The Climate Change & Sustainability course is used because it is:

- universally relevant

- low-barrier for learners

- rich in practical GenAI use cases

- naturally mapped to all six domains

- ethically manageable and pedagogically clean

By the end of this section, readers will understand how the Framework is applied in practice — and how they can replicate this process for any topic.

**  **

# **4.1 WHY GENERATIVE AI MATTERS FOR CLIMATE ACTION**

  
Climate change is one of the most complex, multi-layered challenges facing society. Effective climate action requires:

- rapid communication

- public engagement

- data interpretation

- adaptation planning

- policy development

- community education

- emotional resonance

GenAI can support these processes by enabling:

### **✔ simplified explanations of complex science**

### **✔ translation, localisation, and cultural adaptation**

### **✔ rapid drafting of climate communications**

### **✔ prototyping community engagement resources**

### **✔ visual scenario exploration**

### **✔ synthesising reports and articles**

### **✔ creative ideation for campaigns**

However, climate misinformation, hallucinated statistics, and ethically insensitive content are **major risks**.

The Climate course therefore needs to be:

- **practical** (hands-on skills)

- **innovative** (AI-supported creativity)

- **responsible** (aligned with climate justice, science accuracy, and global equity)

- **framework-grounded** (mapped clearly to the six domains)

This section shows how those goals are met.

This climate example shows how the AI Capability Framework supports **engaging, responsible, future-ready AI learning**.

# **SECTION 5 — SHORT SUPPLEMENTARY EXAMPLES**

  
This section provides **two concise, domain-specific examples** that demonstrate how the Six-Domain AI Capability Framework can be applied to other areas beyond climate change.

These examples reinforce a key message of the Handbook:

> **The Framework is universal — it applies to any profession, any discipline, and any AI use case.**

The two chosen examples are:

- **Humanitarian Crisis Response** — demonstrating complexity, high-stakes risk, and global equity

- **Public Health Communication** — demonstrating clarity, safety, trust, and public engagement

Each is intentionally concise (1 page) to show how easily the Framework adapts to new contexts.

# **SECTION 7 — CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS**

  
This final section brings the Handbook together — summarising the core ideas, reinforcing the practical method, and presenting clear pathways for educators, learners, organisations, and partners to continue developing responsible, innovative, and future-ready AI capability.

#  ****

**  **

# **7.1 SUMMARY OF THE UNIVERSAL METHOD**

  
The AI Capability Framework Application Handbook provides a **complete translation pathway** from conceptual framework → applied method → real courses.

### **That pathway has seven essential steps:**

1.  **Define the purpose and learner needs  **
    Identify real problems, real audiences, and desired capability growth.

2.  **Identify real-world use cases and risks  **
    Anchor the course in authentic tasks that matter in the domain.

3.  **Map each use case to the Six Domains  **
    Use capability logic to shape the learning architecture.

4.  **Translate domains into practical modules  **
    Create action-oriented module titles and module purpose statements.

5.  **Use the universal lesson structure  **
    3 practical lessons + 1 activity + 1 downloadable per module.

6.  **Build cross-domain links for responsible innovation  **
    Ensure ethics, governance, and reflection are embedded throughout.

7.  **Validate using the Framework Checklist  **
    Confirm the course is practical, innovative, safe, and aligned with the Framework.

**  **

### **Together, these steps ensure that every course built using this Handbook is:**

- pedagogically strong

- ethically grounded

- engaging for learners

- aligned with organisational values

- flexible across multiple sectors

- deeply practical and future-proof

- consistent across the CloudPedagogy ecosystem

This method is now your primary **design engine** for all future CloudPedagogy courses and workshops.
