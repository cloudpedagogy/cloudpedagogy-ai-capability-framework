# Using the AI Capability Framework in Practice

## Purpose of This Guide

This short guide explains how the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework ecosystem** fits together in practice. It is designed to help users understand how to use the existing materials — scenarios, briefs, quizzes, slides, and handbooks — in a coherent, flexible way.

This document does **not introduce new concepts**. Instead, it clarifies how the existing components work together as a single, integrated system that supports **responsible, defensible AI‑supported decision‑making**.

*This guide is intended as orientation and documentation, not as a learning module or assessment resource.*

The Framework is intentionally modular. You do not need to use every component at once. Different pathways are appropriate for different roles, contexts, and levels of maturity.

## The AI Capability Framework as a System

At its core, the AI Capability Framework provides a shared language and decision structure for working with AI in education, research, and public service contexts.

Around this core sits a set of applied resources, each serving a distinct function:

* **Framework & Handbook** — the conceptual foundation and reference point
* **Scenarios** — contextual decision situations
* **Capability Briefs** — role‑specific guidance
* **Quizzes & Reflection Tools** — diagnostic and sense‑making tools
* **Slides & Facilitation Materials** — shared discussion and learning supports

Together, these form a **complete, reusable system**, rather than a linear course.

---

## How the Components Fit Together

### 1. The Framework and Handbook

*(The Reference Layer)*

The AI Capability Framework and its accompanying handbook define:

* the six capability domains
* the underlying principles of responsible human–AI practice
* the kinds of decisions the Framework is designed to support

These materials are not designed to be read once and set aside. They function as a **reference layer** that users return to as questions arise.

---

### 2. Scenarios

*(The Decision Layer)*

Scenarios translate the Framework into realistic situations where AI use raises questions of judgement, responsibility, and trade‑offs.

They are most useful when users are asking:

* *“What does this look like in practice?”*
* *“What would I do in this situation?”*
* *“Which capability domains are under pressure here?”*

Scenarios are deliberately written to be:

* adaptable to local context
* open‑ended rather than prescriptive
* suitable for discussion, reflection, or facilitation

---

### 3. Capability Briefs

*(The Role Layer)*

Capability Briefs provide focused guidance for specific roles or functions (for example: educators, researchers, leaders, professional staff).

They help users to:

* recognise where AI intersects with their responsibilities
* interpret scenarios through a role‑specific lens
* articulate defensible positions using the Framework’s language

Briefs are especially effective as:

* preparatory reading
* discussion primers
* professional development resources

---

### 4. Quizzes and Reflection Tools

*(The Diagnostic Layer)*

Quizzes, self‑assessment tools, and reflection prompts support capability awareness and learning.

They are designed to:

* surface assumptions
* reveal capability gaps or tensions
* prompt reflection rather than produce scores

These tools work best when used:

* before or after scenario discussion
* as part of facilitated workshops
* for individual professional reflection

---

### 5. Slides and Facilitation Materials

*(The Shared Learning Layer)*

Slides and facilitation resources provide a common structure for group engagement.

They support:

* workshops
* seminars
* team discussions
* training sessions

Their role is not to replace discussion, but to:

* create shared reference points
* ensure consistent framing
* support facilitation across different contexts

---

## Suggested Usage Pathways

The Framework ecosystem is intentionally flexible. The pathways below are **common patterns**, not fixed sequences.

---

### Pathway A: Individual Professional Use

*Best for self‑directed learning and reflection.*

1. Start with the Framework overview to understand the six domains
2. Read one or two Capability Briefs relevant to your role
3. Work through a Scenario that resonates with your context
4. Use reflection prompts or quizzes to articulate your reasoning
5. Return to the Framework to refine your judgement

---

### Pathway B: Team or Departmental Discussion

*Best for shared sense‑making and alignment.*

1. Distribute a Capability Brief in advance
2. Use slides to introduce the Framework and session purpose
3. Work through a Scenario in small groups
4. Use guided questions to surface different perspectives
5. Capture insights using the Framework domains as headings

---

### Pathway C: Facilitated Workshop or CPD Session

*Best for structured professional development.*

1. Open with slides to establish shared language
2. Use a quiz or diagnostic activity to surface assumptions
3. Introduce one or more Scenarios for group analysis
4. Anchor discussion explicitly to Framework domains
5. Close with reflection and identification of next steps

---

### Pathway D: Governance or Decision Review

*Best for high‑stakes or formal decision contexts.*

1. Identify the decision under review
2. Use the Framework domains as an evaluation lens
3. Select relevant Scenarios as comparison points
4. Reference Briefs to clarify role‑specific responsibilities
5. Document reasoning using Framework language

---

## Facilitator Use vs Individual Use

### Individual Use

* Self‑paced
* Reflective
* Context‑specific
* Emphasis on personal judgement and learning

Users typically engage with:

* the Framework
* selected Capability Briefs
* Scenarios
* reflection tools

---

### Facilitator Use

* Structured
* Time‑bounded
* Group‑oriented
* Emphasis on shared understanding and accountability

Facilitators typically use:

* slides and session guides
* Scenarios as discussion anchors
* quizzes or prompts to structure reflection
* the Framework to synthesise outcomes

The facilitator’s role is **not to provide answers**, but to help participants articulate **defensible reasoning**.

---

## Final Notes

The AI Capability Framework ecosystem is designed to be:

* modular
* adaptable
* reusable across contexts

There is no single “correct” way to use it. Its value lies in providing a **stable structure for thinking, discussion, and decision‑making** as AI becomes embedded in everyday professional practice.

Users are encouraged to adapt materials responsibly while retaining the **core language and intent** of the Framework.
